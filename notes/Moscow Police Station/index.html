The rail junction was dismantled and the rail tracks were partially disconnected. It must be emphasized that we are not sure that this disconnection was sufficient to free the train from the tracks. But it was a test sabotage, if you will, where we tested the feasibility with the help of tools. We also wanted the sabotage to be as inconspicuous as possible so that the train would not have time to come to a stop. Moreover, it is not sure that a derailment in such a deserted area will reach the media, and we have no possibility to observe it with our own eyes.

Date discrepancy - 23 or 26 May, 2022. Used earliest date. Earliest date confirmed. This section of the road leads to 14258 military unit. It's a secret training and tactical center of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for Russian nuclear security: Some important aspects of this action are: 1) A track was chosen that leads to a military unit where no civilian trains operate in order to avoid innocent victims. We recommend using wikimapia.org for the search. There, military installations are marked that are not visible on conventional maps. You can also use satellite maps to judge whether a facility is “in operation.” For example, on the base to which the attacked sidetrack leads, you can see a collection of military equipment in open areas. 2) This immediately led to restrictions in the possible actions: On these lines, the wagons are pulled by diesel locomotives, so there are no signal cabinets and no power lines. The main point of attack is therefore the tracks themselves 3) We dismantled the rail connection part and unscrewed the screw nuts holding the rail to the railway sleepers. Normal construction tools, adjustable wrenches with a length of &gt; 0.5 m, proved to be sufficient for this. An adjustable wrench is also required because the rail is fastened with 2 types of screw nuts. We recommend the use of a lubricant to make it easier to unscrew the nuts, as many of them are rusty and hardened. 4) Then the track can be lifted with levers and moved to the side. The more nuts that are used to fasten the rail to the sleepers are unscrewed, the easier it is to move it. The method has proven to be quite feasible and safe, although it could cause serious damage to the armed forces of the Russian Federation. We recommend it to all to use it.

On May 28, there was an unsuccessful attempt to set <a href="../fire/">fire</a> to a military recruiting office in Simferopol. On the night of May 28, there was an attack in Crimea. An unidentified one climbed over the fence and entered the territory of the military enlistment office on Selvinsky str. in Simferopol, after which he threw a Molotov cocktail through the basement window. The bottle broke on the window bars and caused no damage to the building. The watchman on duty tried to <a href="../arrested/">detain</a> the attacker, but he broke free and fled before the police arrived. Bottle fragments are seized. The place is symbolic: this street bears the name of a famous Soviet writer, however in his youth he was a Black Guard fighter in the squad of Maria Nikiforova.<br/>

An unknown person smashed the window with an axe in order to <a href="../fire/">burn</a> the enlistment office from inside. Usually such tactics (first break the window, then pour the flammable mixture and set it on <a href="../fire/">fire</a>) prove to be the most effective, but in this case, unfortunately, the staff of the institution managed to quickly put out the flames before the EMERCOM officers arrived to help.

However, we must point out that in a war where the Russian state is killing people in Ukraine, graffiti and leaflets are hardly a sufficient means to stop the killing. A word will not stop a bullet. If you really want to make a difference, you should look for other ways to fight dictatorship and war. Some of these measures are already relatively widespread and popular in Russia–for example, there are regular reports of incendiary attacks on military recruitment centers or acts of sabotage on railroad tracks that can disrupt the Russian army’s infrastructure and supply logistics. We would like to call on all sincere people not to limit themselves to expressing their discontent with the war and the dictatorship, whether on the Internet or in the streets. Words without actions are empty, and the dictatorship has reached the point where it is now or never to act.</p>
<p>prometeya is an <a href="../activism/">anarchist</a>/community direct action group - The admins of Prometeya have been part of the <a href="../activism/">anarchist</a> movement for many years and over the years we have directly participated in <a href="../activism/">anarchist</a> activities, taking part in actions with varying degrees of radicalism and putting ourselves at risk. We have been persecuted and <a href="../war%20crimes/">tortured</a>, suffered many deprivations and had to leave the country because of our activities. In Russia, we face severe punishment and <a href="../war%20crimes/">torture</a>, and we live with the reality that this will happen to us if we are getting deported. “Narodnaya Samooborona” (People’s Self-Defense), our movement, was destroyed due to repression and has suspended its activities for several years now. To a large extent, this also applies to Prometeya–it has practically stopped working as a media source. Nevertheless, the <a href="../activism/">activists</a> of the former People’s Self-Defense and the admins of Prometeya are still active. Some are fighting against the Russian army in Ukraine, putting themselves in great danger. Others are organizing fundraising events for <a href="../activism/">anarchists</a> who are fighting in Ukraine. We will not stay inactive.</p>

Anarcho-Communists Combat Organisation (BOAK) reported on June 28 in own Telegram channel about their second act of railway blocking to the military objects after such action a month ago near Sergiyev Posad: “The BOAK-Vladimir cell takes responsibility for the sabotage on the railway line leading to military unit 55443 VD Barsovo (the 51st arsenal of the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the RF) near Kirzhach. Unlike the previous attack, where we took responsibility without waiting for the result (decided to publish the information to show all the guerrillas how accessible the target was), for subsequent actions we chose the strategy of waiting for the result, not publishing the report until either success was achieved or the facts that the sabotage was discovered will not be received. Unfortunately, in this case, we received reliable information (a video in the offer from a subscriber, apparently, a driver who was driving along this branch) that the sabotage was discovered on the evening of June 25. However, even in this form, the sabotage caused harm to the enemy, delaying the movement of trains with military equipment, and causing economic damage due to the need to restore the railway lines. What has been done:–34 nuts (17 on each side) holding the rail are unscrewed–4 nuts connecting the joint are unscrewed–The rail at the junction is raised, laid on the connecting plate (so as not to fall into place) and set aside.–The rails were connected to each other with a wire, in case a signal current is transmitted along the rail, to detect an open (thanks to the advice from subscribers). We call on everyone to join the rail war! Each stopped train is a minus of shells and rockets that could fly into peaceful Ukrainian cities”.<br/>

<p>When cars are identified as "foreign" which may mean not registered, out of area or out of country. This may or may not be related to other activities.

July 26, the group’s Telegram channel teased passport data for KGB Chairman Ivan Tertel; Central Election Commission Chairwoman Lidiya Yermoshina; the chairwoman of the upper house of parliament, Natallya Kachanova; and ex-Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who has lived in Belarus since his 2010 overthrow from power. Belarusian passports are used both as a domestic identity document and for external travel. Each individual’s dossier, the hackers claim, contains passport photos and data; his or her residence permit; the name of the government body or military unit for which the person works; the names of family members, “and so on.” “Will many KGB agents be ready to operate abroad, knowing that data about them has already leaked?” Aside from passport data, the Cyberpartisans claim to have accessed the records of the Belarusian traffic police, which the hackers say include information on registered cars for the KGB, the anti-corruption police, and tsikhary (“silent men”), masked muscle men in plainclothes known for brutally rounding up suspected protesters.Information was also seized about the KGB’s housing assignments, Cyber-Partisan added, which means “they’ll have to change all the apartments.” “Intelligence, counterintelligence, and KGB employees who have special notes (indicating their occupations) in their passports are completely compromised,” said Andriy Baranovych. “And <a href="../activism/">activists</a>, partisans got the data, not the special services. And now the people who are the backbone of the Lukashenka regime will not feel safe.”<br/>

The rail junction was dismantled and the rail tracks were partially disconnected. It must be emphasized that we are not sure that this disconnection was sufficient to free the train from the tracks. But it was a test sabotage, if you will, where we tested the feasibility with the help of tools. We also wanted the sabotage to be as inconspicuous as possible so that the train would not have time to come to a stop. Moreover, it is not sure that a derailment in such a deserted area will reach the media, and we have no possibility to observe it with our own eyes. Therefore, it was decided to publish the result of the attack “as it was” to share the experience with other guerrillas.<br/>

Date discrepancy - 23 or 26 May, 2022. Used earliest date. Earliest date confirmed. This section of the road leads to 14258 military unit. It's a secret training and tactical center of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for Russian nuclear security: Some important aspects of this action are: 1) A track was chosen that leads to a military unit where no civilian trains operate in order to avoid innocent victims. We recommend using wikimapia.org for the search. There, military installations are marked that are not visible on conventional maps. You can also use satellite maps to judge whether a facility is “in operation.” For example, on the base to which the attacked sidetrack leads, you can see a collection of military equipment in open areas. 2) This immediately led to restrictions in the possible actions: On these lines, the wagons are pulled by diesel locomotives, so there are no signal cabinets and no power lines. The main point of attack is therefore the tracks themselves 3) We dismantled the rail connection part and unscrewed the screw nuts holding the rail to the railway sleepers. Normal construction tools, adjustable wrenches with a length of &gt; 0.5 m, proved to be sufficient for this. An adjustable wrench is also required because the rail is fastened with 2 types of screw nuts. We recommend the use of a lubricant to make it easier to unscrew the nuts, as many of them are rusty and hardened. 4) Then the track can be lifted with levers and moved to the side. The more nuts that are used to fasten the rail to the sleepers are unscrewed, the easier it is to move it. The method has proven to be quite feasible and safe, although it could cause serious damage to the armed forces of the Russian Federation. We recommend it to all to use it.

An unknown person smashed the window with an axe in order to burn the enlistment office from inside. Usually such tactics (first break the window, then pour the flammable mixture and set it on fire) prove to be the most effective, but in this case, unfortunately, the staff of the institution managed to quickly put out the flames before the EMERCOM officers arrived to help.

However, we must point out that in a war where the Russian state is killing people in Ukraine, graffiti and leaflets are hardly a sufficient means to stop the killing. A word will not stop a bullet. If you really want to make a difference, you should look for other ways to fight dictatorship and war. Some of these measures are already relatively widespread and popular in Russia–for example, there are regular reports of incendiary attacks on military recruitment centers or acts of sabotage on railroad tracks that can disrupt the Russian army’s infrastructure and supply logistics. We would like to call on all sincere people not to limit themselves to expressing their discontent with the war and the dictatorship, whether on the Internet or in the streets. Words without actions are empty, and the dictatorship has reached the point where it is now or never to act.</p>
<p>prometeya is an <a href="../activism/">anarchist</a>/community direct action group - The admins of Prometeya have been part of the <a href="../activism/">anarchist</a> movement for many years and over the years we have directly participated in <a href="../activism/">anarchist</a> activities, taking part in actions with varying degrees of radicalism and putting ourselves at risk. We have been persecuted and <a href="../war%20crimes/">tortured</a>, suffered many deprivations and had to leave the country because of our activities. In Russia, we face severe punishment and <a href="../war%20crimes/">torture</a>, and we live with the reality that this will happen to us if we are getting deported. “Narodnaya Samooborona” (People’s Self-Defense), our movement, was destroyed due to repression and has suspended its activities for several years now. To a large extent, this also applies to Prometeya–it has practically stopped working as a media source. Nevertheless, the <a href="../activism/">activists</a> of the former People’s Self-Defense and the admins of Prometeya are still active. Some are fighting against the Russian army in Ukraine, putting themselves in great danger. Others are organizing fundraising events for <a href="../activism/">anarchists</a> who are fighting in Ukraine. We will not stay inactive.</p>

Russian anti-military arsonists: "There are more of us every day". Not everyone is tough enough to go with Molotov to the enlistment office or burn a vehicle to the beasts guarding the regime. But everyone can take a photo and anonymously send along with the coordinates to the right people. Or collect information about beasts, print out leaflets, stick stickers, draw graffiti, supporting resistance. Sabotage at work in the relevant structures is no less important. It is not necessary to refuse military service if you can learn a lot of valuable information through this. It is not necessary to resign from law enforcement bodies if you can sabotage new cases to capture <a href="../activism/">activists</a>. Or leave the railway, seeing trains of equipment going to kill people in a neighboring country. Everyone must find their place in the Russia of the future, become this future today, and not leave Russian hopelessness as a legacy to children military recruitment centers burn every week, trains derail from the Kuban to the Far East, cables from zombieboxes are cut at the entrances. The geography of resistance will only expand, because everyone has just begun to taste the delights of life in a new reality: total lack of freedom, a swooping economy, an Iron Curtain. The fire of the revolution will spread throughout the cities of Russia. The future of Russia will be decided in Russia. This is our land, we have nowhere to run, let the scum be afraid and hide in their palaces. The future belongs to us!<br/>

Anarcho-Communists Combat Organisation (BOAK) reported on June 28 in own Telegram channel about their second act of railway blocking to the military objects after such action a month ago near Sergiyev Posad: “The BOAK-Vladimir cell takes responsibility for the sabotage on the railway line leading to military unit 55443 VD Barsovo (the 51st arsenal of the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the RF) near Kirzhach. Unlike the previous attack, where we took responsibility without waiting for the result (decided to publish the information to show all the guerrillas how accessible the target was), for subsequent actions we chose the strategy of waiting for the result, not publishing the report until either success was achieved or the facts that the sabotage was discovered will not be received. Unfortunately, in this case, we received reliable information (a video in the offer from a subscriber, apparently, a driver who was driving along this branch) that the sabotage was discovered on the evening of June 25. However, even in this form, the sabotage caused harm to the enemy, delaying the movement of trains with military equipment, and causing economic damage due to the need to restore the railway lines. What has been done:–34 nuts (17 on each side) holding the rail are unscrewed–4 nuts connecting the joint are unscrewed–The rail at the junction is raised, laid on the connecting plate (so as not to fall into place) and set aside.–The rails were connected to each other with a wire, in case a signal current is transmitted along the rail, to detect an open (thanks to the advice from subscribers). We call on everyone to join the rail war! Each stopped train is a minus of shells and rockets that could fly into peaceful Ukrainian cities”.<br/>

Comprehensive inspections of civilian firearms owners will continue in the <a href="../Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia.md">Ivanovo</a> region. According to the Department of Rosgvardia for the <a href="../Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia.md">Ivanovo</a> region, in total, since the beginning of 2022, more than 13,000 inspections of the conditions of the preservation of weapons have been carried out in the region, according to the results of which 493 violations were identified, 316 weapons and more than 2 thousand cartridges have been seized. 12 facts of gross violations of the law were also revealed - permits for weapons of these citizens were canceled. More than 22 thousand owners of civilian weapons are registered in the region, in use of which there are about 34 thousand weapons. For 6 months of this year, the Licensing and Licensing and its structural subdivisions received more than 7.3 thousand applications from individuals and legal entities. Thanks to the compensation program for the population in the reporting period, 9 weapons were handed over voluntarily, about 30 thousand rubles were paid to citizens from the regional budget. "Each owner should understand that the conditions for the safety of weapons and ammunition and the safety of their storage must be observed not only at the place of residence. Also, security measures are necessary for transportation, on small arms and in hunting grounds, because lost weapons can become an instrument of crime," the Office of Rosgvardia notes.<br/>

July 26, the group’s Telegram channel teased passport data for KGB Chairman Ivan Tertel; Central Election Commission Chairwoman Lidiya Yermoshina; the chairwoman of the upper house of parliament, Natallya Kachanova; and ex-Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who has lived in Belarus since his 2010 overthrow from power. Belarusian passports are used both as a domestic identity document and for external travel. Each individual’s dossier, the hackers claim, contains passport photos and data; his or her residence permit; the name of the government body or military unit for which the person works; the names of family members, “and so on.” “Will many KGB agents be ready to operate abroad, knowing that data about them has already leaked?” Aside from passport data, the Cyberpartisans claim to have accessed the records of the Belarusian traffic police, which the hackers say include information on registered cars for the KGB, the anti-corruption police, and tsikhary (“silent men”), masked muscle men in plainclothes known for brutally rounding up suspected protesters.Information was also seized about the KGB’s housing assignments, Cyber-Partisan added, which means “they’ll have to change all the apartments.” “Intelligence, counterintelligence, and KGB employees who have special notes (indicating their occupations) in their passports are completely compromised,” said Andriy Baranovych. “And <a href="../activism/">activists</a>, partisans got the data, not the special services. And now the people who are the backbone of the Lukashenka regime will not feel safe.”<br/>

<p>This material is from a 2021 hack that penetrated every government agency, including <a href="../air/">air</a> gapped intelligence. They have been very careful to release only the material that does not harm ordinary citizens. CP, BYPOL, Flying Storks work with Railway Workers to cyber attack the Belarusian railway system in an effort to slow Russia's advances. This was instrumental in the early days of the war to give Ukraine time to organize and prepare.</p>
