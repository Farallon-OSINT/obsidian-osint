Judge of the [[Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia|Ivanovo]] Regional Court Nikolai Matveev in his decision explained the illegality of the draft "No to War": "One of the elements of the objective side of the above administrative offense is public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, maintain international [[anti-war|peace]] and security. The decision to award a fine to Oleg Savinov of 30 thousand rubles was upheld by the regional court. According to the information on the websites of the district courts of the [[Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia|Ivanovo]] region, according to 15 protocols sent to the court under Article 20.3.3 of the Code, decisions were made to award fines; in 5 cases, the courts refused to consider the case, returning them to the police because of the revealed violations in the preparation; in one case, the case was terminated for the absence of an offense; 2 protocols are under consideration. This article of the Administrative Code "…public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, maintain international [[anti-war|peace]] and security, including public calls to prevent the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for these purposes" is punishable by fines for citizens from 30 to 50 thousand rubles.

Discrediting is deliberate actions aimed at undermining trust and authority…24.02.2022 on the basis of the Resolution of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of 22.02.2022 No. 35-SF, the President of the Russian Federation decided to conduct a [[Special Military Operation|Special Military Operation]] on the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, in connection with the appeal of the heads of these republics for assistance. According to the publicly available multilingual universal Internet encyclopedia (Wikipedia), war refers to a conflict between political entities (states, tribes, political groups, etc.) arising from various claims in the form of armed confrontation, military (combat) actions between their armed forces. War as a state between states is characterized by open and large-scale hostilities, during which not only defense objects of another state are destroyed, but also energy, social, transport and residential infrastructure facilities. War implies the seizure of the territory of another state, coercion to abandon ideology and change political regime, transfer of one's own economy to a military regime, as well as partial or complete mobilization. On the contrary, the goals of the [[Special Military Operation|Special Military Operation]] carried out by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation are to protect the population of both republics from neo-Nazis, as well as to demilitarize Ukraine. Professional military personnel take part in a [[Special Military Operation|Special Military Operation]], the [[operations|operation]] is carried out by striking high-precision strikes on military facilities with weapons, with respect for social infrastructure and civilians. Neither the Russian Federation nor the Republic of Ukraine have officially recognized the state of war between states, as required by the provisions of Article 1 III of the Convention on the Opening of Hostilities (The Hague, October 18, 1907). Thus, the inscription indicated by Savinov on the poster about the conduct of war by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation is not true and thus undermines their authority.
