When [[automobiles|cars]] are identified as "foreign" which may mean not registered, out of area or out of country. This may or may not be related to other activities. Adding to see if there is a discernible pattern. There have been other reports in [[Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia|Ivanovo]] of [[automobiles|car]] burnings & also "foreign" [[automobiles|cars]] having been used as "escape" for unmentioned activities.
