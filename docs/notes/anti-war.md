> An **anti-war** [[movement|movement]] (also antiwar) is a social [[movement|movement]], usually in opposition to a particular nation's decision to start or carry on an armed conflict, unconditional of a maybe-existing just cause. The term anti-war can also refer to pacifism, which is the opposition to all use of [[Russian Military Industry|military]] force during conflicts, or to anti-war books, paintings, and other works of art. Many [[activism|activists]] distinguish between anti-war movements and peace movements. Anti-war [[activism|activists]] work through protest and other grassroots means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict or to prevent it in advance.
