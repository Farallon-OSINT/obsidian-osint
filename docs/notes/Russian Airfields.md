In August 1998 it was reported that more than 70 airfields would be closed as part of the [[air|air]] Force's larger effort to streamline its operations. According to the Defense Ministry, some 80 airfields with [[air base|runways]] longer than 1800 meters would remain open. The airfields' closure may free scarce budget funds for the maintenance and reconstruction of the remaining airfields, the bulk of which were constructed during the 1950s through 1970s and have exceeded their expected service life.

Russian [[air base|airbases]] generally have their own energy plant apart from the connection to the normal power grid, and of course plenty of mobile generators.

During mid 1993 at a Russian [[air base|air base]] at Akhtubinsk, near Astrakhan, on the Volga River, a display of [[aircraft|aircraft]] was permitted and only a few journalists new about it to come. Akhtubinsk [[air base|air base]] up until this point was a "closed" facility for the testing or [[air|air]] weapons.

On 21 February 1994 five armed men forced their way into the guardhouse of the Russian [[air base|air base]] at Amari (Suurkula), searched for weapons, and [[fire|burned]] down the post. The base was the last airfield still under Russian military control from which combat [[aircraft|aircraft]] had been removed, but was still frequently used by military transport [[aircraft|planes]]. The Russian Foreign Ministry delivered an official protest to Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn, demanding exhaustive explanations from Estonia and punishment for the organizers and participants in the attack that was described as an "extremely dangerous deliberate action which may lead to unpredictable consequences."

The Ukrainian defense ministry protested the alleged planned takeover of over 20 TU-22M Backfire [[aircraft|aircraft]] by Russia in upcoming Black Sea Fleet military exercises on 4 May 1994. According to the defense ministry, Russia planned to have the [[aircraft|planes]], which belong to the naval aviation arm of the Black Sea Fleet, fly out of their [[air base|air bases]] at Oktyabrskoye and Vesoloye in Crimea to the Russian [[air base|air base]] at Krymsk in [[Maps/Krasnodar Krai, Southern Federal District, Russia|Krasnodar krai]]. The Ukrainian defense ministry said that any attempt to transfer military technology or other Black Sea Fleet assets outside Ukraine would be regarded as illegal acts by Ukraine and would worsen the problem of dividing the fleet. Andrei Grachev, head of the Black Sea Fleet press center, denied that there was any truth to the allegation. According to Grachev the charge was a "figment of the imagination" of the Ukrainian defense ministry.

The Russian Defence Minister, Army General Sergei Shoigu said in Ausut 2015 that about 100 [[air base|airports]] used by armed forces of Russia require major repairs or reconstruction. "Currently, aerospace forces used 125 airfields. Of these, 80% need major repairs or reconstruction," - the minister said at a conference at the National Control Center of Defense of Russia. In this regard, said Shoigu, until 2020 provided reconstruction and repair of 108 airfields. "State aerodrome is directly related to safety," - said the head of the military department.

The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation will carry out a large-scale reconstruction of the aerodrome network in the interests of more operational use of aviation and its safe operation. This was announced by the head of department, Sergei Shoigu, at a meeting of the board of the Ministry of Defense 26 April 2019. According to him, the Ministry of Defense is preparing a draft plan for the repair and reconstruction of 106 airfields.

In particular, the minister said, it is planned to repair more than 13 million square meters. m artificial airfields. In addition, more than 700 power supply facilities, [[air|air]] traffic control, [[aircraft|aircraft]] maintenance and repair will be built, as well as an infrastructure has been created for promising airline complexes. Shoigu stressed that "the further development of the airfield network of the armed forces will allow for more operational use of aviation and its safe operation." The minister said that this work is carried out within the framework of the plan, its action is calculated until 2028.

Shoigu said that over the past five years, artificial [[air base|runways]] of 12 airfields were reconstructed: Vityazevo, Akhtubinsk, Eisk, Krymsk, Korenovsk, Lipetsk, Privolzhsky, Mozdok, Severomorsk-1, Chkalovsky, Chkalovsk and Engels. Currently, work is continuing on another four airfields - Steppe, Baltimore, Temp and Nagurskaya, the minister said, stressing that two of them are located in the Arctic zone. Shoigu also said that this year it is planned to commission six modern [[aircraft|aircraft]] simulators at the airfields of Domna, Vyazma, Morozovsk, Torzhok, Pushkin and Ryazan.
