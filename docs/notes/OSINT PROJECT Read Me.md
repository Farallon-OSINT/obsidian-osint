Hello. Glad you could make it.

If you want to skip the explainer and jump right to it you can start here: Index of Notes: https://osint-project.netlify.app/notes/_Index_of_Russia-Belarus

On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine giving any number of crazy excuses for their invasion, brutality, rape, looting, cultural genocide and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and children.

Due to this, the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Community has banded together, combining specialties and tools in support of Ukraine. Sometimes, it takes a village.

We do not focus on military losses or troop movements. The information we seek with this project is different. For Russia losses, check out Ragnar's awesome dashboard where you can visualize multiple views for the same data in useful and insightful ways.

**A few points about this data.**

- This is a compilation of events that indicate citizens within Russia and Belarus may be taking action as [[anti-war|anti-war]] direct action and sabotage.
- The data of those kinds of events currently spans February 2022 to July 2022, but will be expanded with time.
- The goals of these attacks are to draw attention to the war, to make political and [[anti-war|anti-war]] statements, to decrease the moral of the Russian people and soldiers, and to slow, delay, hinder or otherwise disable infrastructure, strategic targets, supplies, weapons and logistics required by Russia to fight in Ukraine, including using Belarus as a staging ground.
- It is often impossible to verify whether or not an event is an act of sabotage or usual fall out from shoddy Russian building standards and materials. We make best-guess efforts, based on timing, location and targets (whether they might be strategic or political or protest related), claims of individuals or groups as to their direct action activities and legal case filings against people in Russia for "terrorism" or "hooliganism".
- As such, we include all reports if there is the potential of sabotage to leave room for more information to become available. It is up to you to include or exclude the events of your choice, based on your own criteria
- In all cases, we have taken steps to protect the identities of vulnerable individuals or groups. In cases where names and details linked to them have been made officially public in Russia or Belarus, we have retained that information (such as arrest or court records). In cases of self-attribution, we have included this at our discretion as well.
- This data was compiled from reporting in global media, local and regional reporting, curated Telegram channels, [[activism|activist]] websites, alert and monitoring programs and apps, and from curated accounts on Twitter such as @AmplifyUkraine, @VelvetBlade, @DemeryUK, @TWMCLtd, @StillDelvingH, @HarladF, @Russiasonfire, @Bellingcat
- This data was augmented by several sources including lists of military contracting companies and factories within Russia, Wikipedia, WordNik, WordNet, CartoDB and articles. 
- This vault also contains some data on filtration camps and locations where Ukrainians citizens may be sent to within Russia, including children.
- This vault will be updated as more data becomes available and more "care and feeding" goes into drawing out meaning and connections

**How to Use this Vault**

This vault was created with Obsidian, a free and expandable open source markdown project. It has been Published through Digital Garden for Obsidian, which has allowed us to post these bits of data for you to enjoy without the hassles of coding or self hosting. As such, expect things to improve over time.

Obsidian is a rich community of enthusiasts and this project has been enhanced on the shoulders of several plug-ins most notably:

- Adjacency Matrix Viewer
- Breadcrumbs
- Dataview
- Find unlinked files and unresolved links
- Digital Garden
- NLP
- Obsidian 42 - BRAT
- Journey
- Translator
- Linter
- Note Refactor
- Map View (set with CARTO DB)
- Omni Search
- Topic Linking
- Juggl
- Graph Analysis
- Wikipedia
- Obsidian 42 - WordNet
- WordNik
- Zootelkeeper

**Roadmap**

Obsidian is an excellent markdown tool and can do many things. This use is not really how it was intended to be used, but we wanted to stretch and create a use case for the OSINT potential within Obsidian. Getting some of these roadmap items to work with Obsidian might be a bit of a dance, but we are of the mind that one should always look at a problem and find potential solutions. This sparks the creativity of puzzle solvers.

- Currently most of this work is done by hand and so is in a constant state of "in progress". Automating some of this once there is a baseline is a goal.
- Add curated and translated Telegram posts from https://osintukraine.com (If you want to support an excellent OSINT project that helps Ukraine in many ways, please support this one by Ben Borges)
- Update potential sabotage database to correlate with our ongoing AirTable
- Fix issue with maps where icons are all the same
- Expand export capabilities
- *Automate:*
    - Entity recognition based on the hand curated entities
    - Topic modeling
    - Scraping
    - AirTable events list with Obsidian
    - Real time OSINT Ukraine data and analysis
- Analysis of known camp locations within Russia
- Extrapolate and prognosticate potential unidentified locations of camps in Russia

**Integrations**
- OSINT Ukraine
- Add Aviary for video and images
- Open Calais
- Open Sherlock
