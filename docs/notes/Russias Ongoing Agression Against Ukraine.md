As delivered by Ambassador Michael Carpenter  
to the Permanent Council, Vienna  
April 28, 2022

We should expect Russia to intensify its ongoing forced transfers of local populations from areas of Ukraine’s south and east to Russia or Russia-controlled parts of the Donbas via so-called “[[Camps|filtration camps]].”  We see credible reporting that Russia’s forces are rounding up the local civilian populations in these areas, detaining them in these [[Camps|camps]], and brutally interrogating them for any supposed links to the legitimate Ukrainian government or to independent media outlets.  There are alarming reports that those suspected of having such connections are being beaten or tortured before being transferred to the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic,” where they are reportedly disappeared or murdered. Reporting indicates that many civilians in these [[Camps|filtration camps]] who “pass” the interrogation are transferred to Russia or Russia-controlled Donbas, including via Belarus.  Our information indicates Russia is abducting, torturing, and/or murdering locally elected leaders, journalists, and civil society activists, as well as religious leaders.
