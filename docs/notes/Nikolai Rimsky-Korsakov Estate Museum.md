Over half of the exhibits have been destroyed in the blaze, which has devastated more than 1,000 artefacts. Reports of the [[fire|fire]] originally emerged from the governor of the district, Mikhail Vedernikov who posted a photo of the [[fire|fire]] on his Telegram [social media] account, saying the damage was “significant”. The [[fire|fire]] is said to have been started due to “the negligence of builders” who were repairing the roof of the museum using a ‘hot work’ technique–construction that uses open flames. Starting on the roof, the [[fire|fire]] spread “very quickly” throughout the building according to Vedernikov, engulfing the estate before firefighters were able to arrive
