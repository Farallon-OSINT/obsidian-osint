During the summer and autumn of 2020, [[Belarusian security forces|Belarusian security forces]] became a collective symbol of cruelty - they massively [[arrested|arrested]], [[beat|beat]] and [[tortured|tortured]] [[protesters|protesters]] against [[Alexander Lukashenko|Alexander Lukashenko]]. But some employees still refused to follow such orders - and resigned from the [[authorities|authorities]]. Now some of them are part of [[BYPOL|BYPOL]] - in it former security forces [[investigate the crimes|investigate the crimes]] of their colleagues against protesters and lure them to their side. Medusa tells how former Belarusian [[policemen|policemen]] and [[investigators|investigators]] are trying to create an ideal [[Ministry of Internal Affairs|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].

Mass protests in Belarus began on August 9, immediately after the presidential election. A week later, [[Andrei Ostapovich|Andrei Ostapovich]], a [[Minsk|Minsk]] investigator with five years of experience in the UK, resigned. In his report, he explained that he could not "fulfill criminal orders" and "participate in the concealment of crimes" by the security forces - by that time thousands of protesters had [been [[arrested|detained]]](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/08/16/hoteli-peremen-suki) throughout Belarus, many of them were beaten and [[war crimes|tortured]].

Even before his dismissal, Ostapovich repeatedly participated in protests. For example, on August 10 and 12, he himself had to run away from his colleagues in the authorities to avoid [[arrested|detention]]. On other days, he went to work actions - he went to so-called political trips, that is, he worked out reports of possible crimes at demonstrations. For example, Andrei's work had a statement that during the protests, riot police officers [[arrested|detained]] a 16-year-old young man, inserted a baton in his mouth and forced him to sing the anthem of Belarus - and after refusal beat him.

Ostapovich explained to Medusa that the management did not allow him to investigate such cases - and he decided to quit. After that, he wrote a report in which he declared the "bandit actions" of the security forces, went to another protest, and then decided to leave Belarus.

Returning home, I reread the report, thought that the text turned out to be too emotional - and it should be rewritten in a regular dismissal report. Then I went to the window and saw that the girls continued [to stand at the action with flowers](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/08/13/v-belarusi-poyavilas-novaya-taktika-protesta-tsepi-solidarnosti-s-postradavshimi-demonstrantami-zhenschiny-vtoroy-den-vyhodyat-na-mirnye-aktsii). I looked at people fighting, holding on, and didn't want to stand aside, I decided that I would leave everything as it is. I decided that I would leave for a week to see the situation: what will happen, how the management will react to my report and what should I do in the future.

The investigator went to [[Maps/Moscow, Central Federal District, Russia|Moscow]] to visit his friends. And the next day I learned that the management, having received the report, began to look for it. Ostapovich was worried that he might be [[arrested|detained]] in Russia, after which he would be extradated to the Belarusian special services. And he contacted the Embassy of Latvia to ask for political asylum. There Ostapovich was told that it was better to negotiate this with Latvian border guards on the land border between Russia and Latvia (about nine hours drive from [[Maps/Moscow, Central Federal District, Russia|Moscow]]). But the investigator was not allowed to do this: he was not released from Russia due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Then Ostapovich went to [[Pskov|Pskov]] - there was the [[consulate|consulate]] of [[Latvia|Latvia]] closest to the border. He was told: it takes officials three days to make a decision. Meanwhile, on August 20, a criminal case was opened against the investigator under the article "on the inaction of an official" in [[Belarus|Belarus]]. And two days later, Ostapovich was [[arrested|detained]] in a [[Maps/Pskov, Pskov Oblast, Northwestern Federal District, 180000, Russia|Pskov]] hotel and a protocol on petty [[hooliganism|hooliganism]] was drawn up against him - allegedly he was swearing in a public place.

"This is done when it is necessary to hold a person, a standard approach. At the same time, I was [[arrested|detained]] in a room that is not a public place, and there was no motherhood there in principle," Ostapovich explains.

The investigator was taken from the hotel to the police department, where Ostapovich was informed: they were "interested in the FSB." In the police, the Belarusian spent about a day - then he was taken out through an emergency exit, which already had six or eight masked people. All things were taken away from Andrei, a ski mask and handcuffs were handcuffed, to which the kettlebell was attached. And they got into the minibus.

"Sometimes the thought swept through my head that I was being taken to throw into some river. I didn't understand what was going on. What weights are in the 21st century? I used to see this only in the movies. Psychological pressure was enormous. The security forces demanded a phone password to allegedly turn off geolocation, but all four hours of the road I didn't say a word. By sound, I tried to figure out where we were going. When passing [[automobiles|trucks]] were heard one by one, I realized that we were going towards the border," said the former investigator.

Ostapovich's [[automobiles|car]] was already taken out on the territory of Belarus - in the Vitebsk region. There was also a notification that he was deported from Russia for "illegal [[arrested|detention]] of Russian citizens." The investigator was explained that these citizens are Wagner [[PMC|PMC]] fighters [[arrested|detained]] in Belarus shortly before the elections. The Minsk investigator had nothing to do with their [[arrested|detention]] - he himself assumes that it was just a formal reason to return him to Belarus.

A few minutes after disembarking from the minibus, another bus arrived at the site. Inside, Andrei noticed men who looked like law enforcement officers - presumably, they were KGB officers. Ostapovich did not wait for them - and fled to the forest.

"There was a moment when I hid and the people who ran after me walked literally a few meters away. I was lying in the grass, I was wearing a light shirt, and at that moment it seemed to me that it was literally glowing. I lay for about an hour, it always seemed that they were still watching me. At one point, I gathered my strength and decided to run further," Ostapovich explained.

He spent about two weeks on the run. Sometimes, according to him, you had to walk more than 70 kilometers a day and drink water from streams. Wild [[animals|animals]] met on the way more than once: "As a child, I was told stories that if you meet a wild boar in the forest, you can seriously suffer. I remembered it when I saw their traces on earth. A moment later, a wild boar ran out of the bushes, and I, fortunately, managed to light up his eyes and run away."

With such runs, Ostapovich managed to run to the border with "one of the EU countries" (he does not call it). He crossed the border itself by swimming. On the other side of the border, Andrei ran further, and having reached civilization, he withdrew the last 480 euros from the card - the investigator bought a phone and a SIM card with them, and also paid for several nights in a hotel.

# "Disclosure of crimes against the Belarusian people"

Now Ostapovich is in Poland - he forms political asylum and lives in Warsaw, where he founded the BYPOL project. The former investigator decided to help the security forces, who, like him, were persecuted because of their political views. Initially (as in August) a similar project was tried to [be developed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcM8c86WUcA&ab_channel=BBCNews-%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B1%D0%B0) by a Belarusian businessman living in the United States, Mikita Mikado - he offered financial assistance to all security forces who refused to comply with orders to violence against protesters. However, he decided to suspend the project after several employees of his company PandaDoc [were [[arrested|arrested]]](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/12/04/vsego-kak-budto-i-ne-bylo) in Minsk.

The official date of creation of BYPOL is considered to be October 20, 2020, when former presidential candidate of Belarus Svetlana Tikhanovskaya (the opposition believes that she lost the elections only because of falsifications) met in Warsaw with several Belarusian security forces who left the service due to disagreement with Lukashenko's policy. Ostapovich was also at the meeting.

"After the meeting with Tikhanovskaya, more and more people began to address us. When a fairly strong team was formed, it became clear that our activities could not be limited to helping employees [bodies]. We have begun to engage in investigations and operational work related to the disclosure of crimes against the Belarusian people," says Ostapovich.

The Belarusian diaspora and the BySol solidarity fund, which raises funds for the affected Belarusians, helped to purchase the equipment necessary for BYPOL's work. Ostapovich claims that now the project exists both at the expense of the help of diasporas and with the participants' own money. He did not disclose the total budget of the project.

BYPOL works in several offices in Poland and other EU countries, where former employees of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Investigative Committee and the prosecutor's office, as well as volunteers are looking for new supporters and processing the incoming data. Any representative [of](https://t.me/By_Pol) Belarusian law enforcement agencies can contact the [telegram channel](https://t.me/By_Pol) of the organization. BYPOL, in turn, offers assistance to such security forces. The organization also helps to leave the country - through Russia to Ukraine or EU countries. In total, BYPOL helped about 30 former security forces leave.

At the same time, the project staff maintain special lists of applied security forces. They are recorded in a special "book" of employees who "fight for the truth" - now there are more than 500 people in it. In turn, these security forces tell BYPOL about what is now happening in the bodies.

They manage to get other "unique information" by hacking state databases, admit to BYPOL, IT specialists cooperating with the organization help to do so. According to Ostapovich, it is not difficult to hack these bases. In addition, BYPOL works in conjunction with other public projects that appeared in the wake of protests. For example, with project [23.34](https://www.23-34.net/), where the protesters themselves talk about their detentions, and the "Unified Crime Registration Book" ([ECRP](https://ekrp.org/ekrp/)), where everyone can download information about the crime by the security forces.

All this information, according to him, helps to identify the perpetrators among the current employees of the bodies. "We own a certain amount of information ourselves, plus we have the skills to analyze information from open sources. In addition, the data is transmitted to us by employees working in the field. We analyze all this, compare it, establish a chain of events and look for the guilty," Ostapovich explained to Medusa.

Lists of security forces who, according to the project staff, are guilty of crimes against protesters, BYPOL, with the mediation of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, transmits to EU representatives. Ostapovich explained to Medusa that this could lead both to personal sanctions against individual security forces and to the international isolation of the power bloc of Belarus - for example, to problems with the supply of special means. For example, light noise grenades, which were used in the acceleration of demonstrations in Minsk, [were produced](https://www.svoboda.org/a/30775983.html) in the Czech Republic.

"Now we understand that if you rock the agenda for the security forces, the rest of the apparatus that exists will quickly fall. Lukashenko himself [admitted](https://reform.by/191046-lukashenko-poka-poslednij-omonovec-mne-ne-skazhetsja-uhodit-ja-budu-nagluho-stojat-v-jetoj-strane) at his meeting with the riot police that until the last of them tells him to leave, he will not leave," said Yevgeny Medvedev, PR and GR manager of BYPOL, in a conversation with Medusa.

# Italian security strike

BYPOL claims that the project has information about more than a thousand crimes by Belarusian security forces. On December 20, the project [published](https://yandex.by/turbo/b-g.by/s/news/na-sayte-edinoy-knigi-registracii-prestupleniy-opublikovan-pervyiy-spisok-iz-28-gotovyih-materialov-proverki/) the first 28 materials - it included cases of election fraud, [[war crimes|torture]] and beatings. In addition, a list of persons listened [to](https://ex-press.by/rubrics/obshhestvo/2020/12/20/by_pol-opublikoval-spisok-licz-kotoryx-po-dannym-byvshix-silovikov-proslushivaet-mvd) by the Ministry of Internal Affairs [was made](https://ex-press.by/rubrics/obshhestvo/2020/12/20/by_pol-opublikoval-spisok-licz-kotoryx-po-dannym-byvshix-silovikov-proslushivaet-mvd) publicly available. 89 names got into it. Including at least 39 active (and former) teachers and students of Minsk State Linguistic University (MSLU).

# WHY THIS UNIVERSITY?

- ["We took part in unauthorized actions under non-state symbols." Participants of the student demonstration were [[arrested|detained]] in Minsk](https://meduza.io/news/2020/09/05/prinimali-uchastie-v-nesanktsionirovannyh-aktsiyah-pod-negosudarstvennnoy-simvolikoy-v-minske-zaderzhali-uchastnikov-studencheskoy-demonstratsii)

According to Yevgeny Medvedev's forecast, the project will produce more and more such materials. The number of security forces cooperating with him will also grow. According to him, now in many Belarusian law enforcement agencies employees are sabotaging work or moving on to Italian strikes - that is, they work, strictly observing the rules and obligations. This greatly limits the work of departments - and interferes with the work of the current government.

What is happening today is the gradual degradation and disintegration of law enforcement agencies. Our task is to make it happen quickly and as painfully as possible for the security forces inside, but at the same time painless for society.

BYPOL emphasizes that the heads of departments, not ordinary employees who followed orders, are primarily guilty of the cruelty of the security forces. At the same time, quite successful employees also take the side of the project.

Igor Loban is a former investigator for particularly important cases of the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee for the Grodno region, Major of Justice. He was one of the first to join BYPOL - immediately after he was sent to initiate criminal proceedings against protesters in early August. Having received such an order, Loban just turned off the phone and left the service. He also [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CD3RgTfMEDf/?igshid=1k8ccaaq0edxx) an appeal on Instagram to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Belarus Yuri Karaev (later [dismissed](https://meduza.io/news/2020/10/29/aleksandr-lukashenko-uvolil-glavu-mvd-belarusi-yuriya-karaeva)), in which he criticized the actions of the security forces.

"10 minutes after my appeal, my managers started calling me. They said they were already leaving for me. I hid for a few days, but my comrades from the KGB reported that they were going to open a criminal case against me. Then I moved to Poland," Loban told Medusa.

In Warsaw, Loban met with Ostapovich - and joined his project. Among the areas of BYPOL's work, the former investigator for particularly important cases notes the receipt of audio and video from existing employees. For example, on the [YouTube channel of the](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs-6x-6RKU_1ks1DNKi2oqA/videos) project you can watch videos recorded on the chest chambers of Belarusian security forces. They show how detainees were treated in paddy wagons and what happened in the police departments.

The last [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1cUDMEHATA) on the channel was published on December 18. The action takes place on August 12 in one of the police department of Minsk. The people on the video, including minors and women, are in the gym of the department. Some stand along the wall on their knees facing the floor, their hands are tied behind their backs, someone is lying on the floor. People are beaten, screams are heard.

According to Loban, such actions are supported by a minority of security forces - mainly employees of the riot police and other similar structures. According to him, in some units about 70% of employees have already contacted BYPOL. All communication with them takes place in secure messengers.

Igor Loban

In the age of information technology, we have ways of conspiracy, and we do not worry that our sources can be disclosed. In order for the leak, the authorities will have to agree with [the creator of the Telegram messenger] Pavel Durov, which, in our opinion, is simply unrealistic.

Andrei Ostapovich in a conversation with Medusa also admitted that the Belarusian security forces are now actively trying to figure out their colleagues cooperating with his project - but so far there have been no such cases.

Another member of BYPOL - former senior operative of the Main Department of Internal Affairs of the Minsk City Executive Committee Matvey Kupreychik - stressed that high-ranking security forces are not afraid to contact the project. Thanks to this, on December 28, the project managed to publish [an audio recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXg8wSgWU94) of the alleged conversation of former Interior Minister Karaev about the political component of the case of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's husband Sergei. Among other things, the voice on the recording, allegedly belonging to Karaev, calls Tikhanov "destroyor of the state" and "creature".

# WHO IS SERGEI TICHANOVSKY?

Her campaign is held under the slogan "Stop cockroach", and with success](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/06/02/konkurent-prezidenta-belorussii-na-vyborah-zhena-arestovannogo-blogera-ee-kampaniya-prohodit-pod-lozungom-stop-tarakan-prichem-s-uspehom)

# "We broke into the apartment, put a gun to my head."

Vladimir Zhigar is a former operative of the criminal investigation department of the Mozyr police department, police lieutenant. Even before the elections, he resigned from the authorities, participated in many rallies, several times was among the people who guarded Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.

On August 10, Zhigar was [[arrested|detained]] in his apartment by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. "They broke into the apartment, put a gun to my head and to the heads of my comrades who were with me at that time. After that, we were taken away and handed over to the riot police," Vladimir told Meduza. Despite the fact that the [[arrested|detention]] took place in the apartment, the protocol stated that Vladimir was walking along Pobediteley Avenue in Minsk and shouted "anti-state slogans," he added.

Now Zhigar, like many former Belarusian security forces, is located in Poland and is engaged in the development of BYPOL. Among other things, the preparation of a reform of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, on which the project is working together with one of the representative bodies of the opposition, the National Anti-Crisis Directorate (NAU). It is headed by former Minister of Culture Pavel Latushko - until August 2020 he headed the Yanka Kupala Theater, but was fired after the protests began.

# INTERVIEW WITH LATUSHKO

- ["We are not the opposition. We are the majority" Pavel Latushko was the Minister of Culture of Belarus, then headed the leading theater of the country, became an active participant in the protests - and he was fired. We talked to him](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/08/19/my-ne-oppozitsiya-my-bolshinstvo)

The proposed reform of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in NAU is supervised by Svetlana Khilko - she herself graduated from the Academy of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs and worked in law enforcement agencies for five years. In 2012, Khilko resigned from SK with the rank of captain, moved to the United States and began working in the field of IT. And when the mass protests began, she wanted to help the demonstrators and entered the NAU.

She had the idea of reform in the autumn of 2020. According to her, by that time it was already clear that without such a reform, the Ministry of Internal Affairs simply could not exist, as it had turned into a system of political investigation and "suppression of will" of Belarusians.

Khilko explained to Medusa that about 20 people are involved in the work on the reform (not counting third-party consultants) and its principles have already been formulated. Most importantly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs should return to the protection of the rights of ordinary citizens and establish communication with people. According to NAU, this can be facilitated, among other things, by the renaming of the police into the police.

Another important point is the decentralization of the department, after which the police of any city will not be directly controlled only by the Minister of the Interior.

Now law enforcement officers lack a sense of responsibility. They say that they received an order from above, but few people understand that everyone is responsible for making decisions. There have already been examples in Belarus when policemen stopped dispersing peaceful demonstrators. People on the spot have to decide for themselves how they will live.

# WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA?

- [We know that the law enforcement system in Russia is rotten. But how did it happen - and what to do about it? All important questions are answered by sociologist Kirill Titayev](https://meduza.io/feature/2019/06/26/my-znaem-chto-pravoohranitelnaya-sistema-v-rossii-prognila-no-kak-eto-proizoshlo-i-chto-s-etim-delat)

While the oppositionists are preparing to create a new Ministry of Internal Affairs, the old one, according to their data, has already faced a large-scale staff leak. On January 6, BYPOL [published](https://yandex.by/turbo/intex-press.by/s/2021/01/06/by_pol-rasskazal-skolko-militsionerov-uvolilos-posle-vyborov/) an internal analytical review of the staffing of the Ministry of Internal Affairs system for the first nine months of 2020. The author of the secret document is the head of the department for coordination and interaction of personnel units and ideological work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Colonel Alexander Mazur. Within the first nine months of 2020, 2,091 employees resigned from the department, while in the third quarter, when protests began in the country, there were more than half of the dismissals - 1,074 people. According to BYPOL, by the beginning of 2021, there were even more resigned - many security forces had contracts ended on December 31, a significant part of them refused to renew the contract with the state (the exact number of employees who refused to extend contracts in BYPOL plans to be named later).

However, according to the project, now the Belarusian authorities are actively preparing for the onset of spring and the continuation of mass protests: they are purchasing weapons, bulletproof vests and special means. Matvey Kupreychik in a conversation with Medusa noted that this may not help in conditions of shortages.

"As soon as it gets warmer, people will start going out en masse again. And now all factors say that it will be much more difficult to suppress a new wave of protest to the authorities and the power bloc than in August," Kupreychik is sure.

# Belarusian "Cyberpartisans" seem to have hacked into the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and have been publishing information compromising security forces for a month Including how they entrusted "*******" to protesters and arrange a "gon hunting" on them.

According to Cyber Guerrillas, these are footage from surveillance cameras in the IVS on Okrestina in Minsk, where protesters were [[war crimes|tortured]] after the beginning of protests.

"Cyberpartisans"

"Cyberpartisans" is a group of hackers from Belarus, which [declared](https://meduza.io/episodes/2020/09/25/v-belorusskih-protestah-uchastvuyut-hakery-oppozitsionery-kiberpartizany-kto-oni-i-pochemu-oni-ugroza-dlya-silovikov-podderzhivayuschih-lukashenko) itself in September 2020, in the midst of protests against Alexander Lukashenko. Its participants [called it](https://t.me/cpartisans/3) their goal to search for information about those involved in repression. "Cyber guerrillas" [gained](https://meduza.io/episodes/2020/09/25/v-belorusskih-protestah-uchastvuyut-hakery-oppozitsionery-kiberpartizany-kto-oni-i-pochemu-oni-ugroza-dlya-silovikov-podderzhivayuschih-lukashenko) access to the database of security forces, began to hack the websites of government agencies and were remembered by a number of symbolic actions - for example, [they showed](https://meduza.io/news/2020/09/27/kiberpartizany-vzlomali-onlayn-translyatsiyu-belorusskih-goskanalov-i-pokazali-video-izbieniya-protestuyuschih) a video of beating protesters on the [[air|air]] of Belarusian state channels and [included](https://meduza.io/news/2020/09/04/sayt-mvd-belarusi-vzlomali-i-dobavili-lukashenko-v-spisok-razyskivaemyh) Lukashenko in the list of wanted on the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus. In the future, the CyberPartisans continued to hack, but their actions did not receive a wide resonance. And at the end of July 2021, the group announced Operation Heat, which it called the largest cyber attack in the history of Belarus. After that, hackers began to publish information compromising Belarusian law enforcement agencies almost every day. Medusa tells what kind of information it is, how it was managed to get it, what consequences their leakage may have and how the current Belarusian authorities react to it.

## Over the past month, "Cyberpartisans" told about the hacking of numerous bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs - and showed fragments from them

- On July 26, the group announced access to the automated information system (AIS) "GAI-Center", which contains information about registered [[automobiles|vehicles]]. "Cyberpartisans" posted photos of Belarusian officials, probably taken during the registration of a driver's license, and also published information about the accident with the participation of the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Olga Chemodanova.
- On July 27, "Cyberpartisans" said that they had received information from the AIS "Passport", which is used by passport and visa units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus. They posted passport details of Lukashenko himself, his sons Victor, Dmitry and Nikolai, as well as photos of Nikolai and his alleged mother Irina Abelskaya, who used to be Lukashenko's personal doctor.
- On July 28, Cyberpartisans published fragments of documents with information about people who allegedly called the police and reported the whereabouts of the protesters. This information was obtained as a result of hacking into the 102 service database, hackers said.
- On July 29, the group announced the hacking of the base of the Department of its own security (USB) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus and published information about people who, judging by the documents, work in GUBOPIK and OMON - units that [actively participated](https://meduza.io/feature/2021/01/15/v-belarusi-vylozhili-zapis-vystupleniya-zamministra-mvd-pered-podchinennymi) in suppressing protests.
- On July 30, hackers showed two videos from protest actions made from above and told about the hacking of the server, where "videos of operational drones of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" are stored. On the same day, "Cyberpartisans" told about the hacking of surveillance cameras in an [[arrested|detention]] center on Okrestina in Minsk, where protesters were beaten and [[war crimes|tortured]]. And the next day they announced a "fatal blow to the system of speed recording and surveillance cameras."
- On August 4, "Cyberpartisans" allegedly posted information from the database of the Main Directorate of Personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
- On August 5, they published data on positive tests for coronavirus from the hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
- On August 8, hackers showed fragments of data from the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Besporyadki", where, apparently, information about the detainees at the protests was collected.
- On August 26, the telegram channel "Cyberpartizan" reported that the database of employees of the Investigative Committee of Belarus was hacked.

These publications did not contain complete data to which, according to Cyberpartisans, they gained access - only fragments. At the same time, in some fragments hackers concealed personal data (when it came to the defendants in the "Conversary" database), and in others they left them open (when it came to law enforcement officers and "scausers"). "Cyberpartisans" also stated that these security forces will get into telegram channels and sites that publish personal information about those involved in the repression in Belarus.

## Based on Cyberpartizan plums, journalists calculated excess mortality during the pandemic in Belarus

Whether Cyberpartisan really has access to the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is impossible to fully check. However, journalists of [Zerkalo.io](https://news.zerkalo.io/life/852.html) and "Present Time" [asked for](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/hakery-vzlomali-pasporta/31385554.html) personal data about themselves or their acquaintances who agreed to participate in the experiment as evidence. In one case, Cyberpartisans sent data from AIS "GAI-Center", in another - from AIS "Passport". In both cases, the data coincided.

In addition, "Cyberpartisans" [shared](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/smertnost-v-belarusi/31401342.html) with "Present Time" an array of personal data of 1.4 million residents of Belarus who died from January 2010 to March 2021 from AIS "Passport". Based on these data, journalists calculated excess mortality during the pandemic in Belarus. They came to the conclusion that from March 2020 to March 2021, this figure amounted to 32 thousand people - 14.4 times more than the authorities reported.

Experts interviewed by "Present Time" said that this conclusion coincides with the conclusions based on previous leaks about deaths in Belarus, and noted that this makes the country one of the most affected countries in Europe.

## Hackers posted conversations between high-ranking police officers. One of them directly entrusted the "*******" to the protesters

In addition, "Cyberpartisans" announced the hacking of DOORD - the department for ensuring the operational and investigative activities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the databases of which audio recordings of wiretapping conversations on mobile phones are stored - and from August 9 to 21 published six audio recordings with conversations of high-ranking police officers of Minsk

Three audio recordings are conversations between Lukashenko spokesman Natalia Eismont and Minsk riot police commander Dmitry Balaba. All conversations allegedly took place on November 2, 2020 - around this time, Eismont, according to [previously published data](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/12/01/telegram-kanal-nexta-opublikoval-zapisi-besed-press-sekretarya-lukashenko), went to cut off [white-red-white](https://meduza.io/feature/2020/08/13/flag-belorusskogo-protesta-belo-krasno-belyy-a-pochemu-otkuda-on-vzyalsya) ribbons in the protest courtyards of Minsk. In a conversation with Balaba, she discusses one of these trips. Eismont [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbHVt8-4dE4) that she and her companions did not meet the protesters, and calls on them to "stretch somehow." Balaba offers to arrange a "wagon hunt." "Ribs are secondary. We need heads," says Eismont. Balaba wishes her a "successful hunt" goodbye.

Two more audio recordings are, according to Cyberpartisans, conversations between Nikolai Maksimovich, Deputy Head of the Public Security Police Department of Internal Affairs of the Minsk Regional Executive Committee. They took place on August 11, 2020, on the third day of protests. Maksimovich instructs interlocutors how the police should behave with the protesters.

That's what he [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9flGN_rkFIA) to one interlocutor, the head of the police from the district city of Soligorsk (here and further his quotes are given with small abbreviations).

The group drove up, *****, [[arrested|detained]] everyone, *****, into the courtyard, *****, everyone lying down, *****, everyone should feel it. Detentions - I say right away, this is my order - should be, *****, tough. I looked wrong, with the phone, *****, everyone *******, *****, don't be ashamed of anyone. Understood? The question is that at the sight of police officers or their transport, *****, those ******** who plan to gather, they must, bitch, stupidly run away. That's the effect in the city then. ****** and we don't be ashamed of anyone.

And here's how he [instructs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPsiabcdiPU) another who asks him what to do with people who sit in the park on benches without protest symbols.

Now the symbolism, [white] bracelets are already, *****, forget it. As soon as at least five people have gathered, not to mention 20, this bus, *****, all ******, ***** arrives, throws them into the bus, delivers them to the regional department, *****. In the courtyard, they all lie muzzle in the asphalt, *****. And women who are just [near], they are very *******, *****, in my experience these days, *****, add fuel to the [[fire|fire]], *****. Taking advantage of the fact that they are not [[arrested|detained]], *****, they begin *******, *****, these to excite us *********. One exception for women, *****, is that they do not lie with their muzzle in the asphalt, *****, but stand near the wall face to wall, *****. Only all *******, *****, - that's the main message. And already *******, what are they doing there, *****: stands just aside, ***** *****, rides a bike, removes from the phone, *****, [[arrested|detain]] everyone and *******.

## Cyberpartisans are cooperating with the initiative of former Belarusian BYPOL security forces. They help hackers with access to the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs

Against the background of the plums of the last month, Western media began to write about Cyberpartisan - in particular, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/belarus-hackers-seek-to-overthrow-local-government) and [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/26/1033205/belarus-cyber-partisans-lukashenko-hack-opposition/). "Cyberpartisans" said that there are 15 people in the group, of whom three or four are actually engaged in hacking, the rest analyze the data obtained and perform other tasks. "Cyberpartisans" claim that there are no professional hackers among them; most are IT industry employees, some used to be engaged in penetration testing. This is the name of the method of assessing the security of information systems through cyber attack modeling.

In December 2020, Cyberpartisans contacted the opposition initiative BYPOL, which was [organized by](https://meduza.io/feature/2021/01/13/apparat-dolzhen-posypatsya) former Belarusian security forces after the start of protests in Belarus. Hackers offered them to act together, [said](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/26/1033205/belarus-cyber-partisans-lukashenko-hack-opposition/) a representative of BYPOL, a former employee of the GUBOPiK of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and former teacher of the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Alexander Azarov. According to him, BYPOL helps "Cyberpartisans" understand the structure of the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, process the data received, identify participants in telephone conversations and get feedback from within the system about the effect of hacking.

In 2021, a like-minded Cyberpartisan received physical access to a government facility in Belarus and, being inside, hacked into a computer network, said a representative of the hacker group. According to him, this helped the "Cyberpartisans" to further gain access to the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The stolen information includes from one to two million minutes of telephone conversations, said the participant of Cyberpartisan.

The group [considers](https://euroradio.fm/pagroza-nacbyaspecy-kiber-partyzany-i-lebyadok-pra-uzlom-bazy-mus) its activities ethical "in the framework of the situation in Belarus." According to hackers, their goal is not only to collect information about those involved in the repression, but also to paralyze the infrastructure of the current Belarusian authorities in "moment X" - so the group [calls](https://telegra.ph/Plan-pobedy-ot-Kiber-Partizan-04-11) the moment of the beginning of the indefinite protest, promising to announce its date later. In Moment X, cyberattacks, according to the idea of Cyberpartisan, will be combined with street protests - and all this will lead to the overthrow of Lukashenko.

## Shortly after the beginning of drains from the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the telegram channels "Cyberpartisan" were recognized as "extremist"

The Belarusian authorities do not directly comment on the "Cyberpartisan" plums. Zerkalo.io [writes](https://news.zerkalo.io/life/1066.html?tg) that in early July, the information services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs worked intermittently. The agency [explained](https://t.me/pressmvd/3182) this[,](https://t.me/pressmvd/3182) among other things, by the "anomalous heat." However, an anonymous Belarusian IT specialist in a conversation with Zerkalo.io [noted](https://news.zerkalo.io/life/852.html) that databases are stored on servers in data centers equipped with [[air|air]] conditioning, so the link to the heat does not look very plausible.

"This will go down in history as "the effect of [Minland Minister of Belarus Ivan] Kubrakov," Cyber Guerrillas [said](https://t.me/cpartisans/236?single) on July 26, the day of the announcement of Operation Heat and the draining of the first data from the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

On July 30, the head of the KGB Ivan Tertel [said](https://news.zerkalo.io/economics/992.html) that the agency records "a sharp increase in the work of foreign special services and related destructive formations." On August 17, Lukashenko [advised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tae4Jb1b1rg) the authorities to switch to paper media if they cannot protect information electronically: "Write by hand and put it in your box." And on August 18, a Belarusian court [recognized](https://mediazona.by/news/2021/08/18/partizans) two telegram channels "Cyberpartisan" as "extremist."

## Leaks from the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs clearly harm Belarusian security forces. But they can also harm ordinary Belarusians

"If the attack is confirmed, it is the largest and most successful hacking of [state systems] since 2015, when Chinese hackers [hacked into the](https://meduza.io/news/2015/06/13/kitayskie-hakery-ukrali-dosie-gossluzhaschih-ssha-s-dopuskami-sekretnosti) servers of the Personnel Service Department in the United States," Andrei Baranovich, a spokesman for the hacker group "Ukrainian Cyber Alliance", [told](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/hakery-vzlomali-pasporta/31385554.html) "Present Time". "They are so sophisticated and attack on several levels, I've only seen this in movies before," Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University of Canada and cyberactivism expert, [told](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/belarus-hackers-seek-to-overthrow-local-government) Bloomberg.

The data posted by Cyberpartisans show that "Belarusian officials knew that they were attacking innocent people and exceeding force for no reason," said digital security specialist from Belarus Nikolai Kvantaliani in a conversation with Bloomberg. Other experts believe that the information received by Belarusian hackers can play a role in case of trials against Lukashenko and his associates in international courts, distrust the ranks of Belarusian security forces and officials, and, on the contrary, encourage protesters.

Belarusian military expert Yegor Lebedok in a conversation with Euroradio [called the](https://euroradio.fm/pagroza-nacbyaspecy-kiber-partyzany-i-lebyadok-pra-uzlom-bazy-mus) incident a "loud failure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" and said that when they get abroad, the information received by "Cyberpartisans" may threaten, among other things, foreign intelligence officers of Belarus. At the same time, as Lebedok emphasized, the leak from the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is dangerous not only for security forces, but also for ordinary citizens - because their data can also be disclosed. Cyberpartisans themselves [assure](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/hakery-vzlomali-pasporta/31385554.html) that [the](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/hakery-vzlomali-pasporta/31385554.html) data of "not working on the mode" people is safe: "We store everything in encrypted form on a separate server that is isolated from the Internet."
