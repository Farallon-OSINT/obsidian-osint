**Roadmap**

Obsidian is an excellent markdown tool and can do many things. This use is not really how it was intended to be used, but we wanted to stretch and create a use case for the OSINT potential within Obsidian. Getting some of these roadmap items to work with Obsidian might be a bit of a dance, but we are of the mind that one should always look at a problem and find potential solutions. This sparks the creativity of puzzle solvers.

- Currently most of this work is done by hand and so is in a constant state of "in progress". Automating some of this once there is a baseline is a goal.
- Add curated and translated Telegram posts from https://osintukraine.com (If you want to support an excellent OSINT project that helps Ukraine in many ways, please support this one by Ben Borges)
- Update potential sabotage database to correlate with our ongoing AirTable
- Fix issue with maps where icons are all the same
- Expand export capabilities
- *Automate:*
    - Entity recognition based on the hand curated entities
