On April 25, an unknown person in [[Moscow|Moscow]] set [[fire|fire]] to a checkpoint of the Kosino-Uchtomsky police station. He threw two Molotov cocktails; however, the [[fire|fire]] was extinguished with own resources and nobody was injured. A guy, dressed in beige pants and a blue hooded jacket, threw two Molotov cocktails at the police building. The bottles bounced off and hit the asphalt. A small [[fire|fire]] was quickly extinguished, and next to the department, operatives found an inscription against [[Special Military Operation|military operations]] in Ukraine. The attacker is now being searched - a criminal case has already begun for “[[hooliganism|hooliganism]]”.
