> A railroad [[automobiles|car]], railcar (American and Canadian English), railway wagon, railway carriage, railway [[automobiles|truck]], railwagon, railcarriage or railtruck (British English and UIC), also called a train [[automobiles|car]], train wagon, train carriage or train [[automobiles|truck]], is a [[automobiles|vehicle]] used for the carrying of [[cargo|cargo]] or [[passengers|passengers]] on a rail [[transportation|transport]] system (a railroad/railway). Such [[automobiles|cars]], when coupled together and hauled by one or more locomotives, form a train. Alternatively, some [[passengers|passenger]] [[automobiles|cars]] are self-propelled in which case they may be either single railcars or make up multiple units.
>
> The term "[[automobiles|car]]" is commonly used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit. Indian English sometimes uses "bogie" in the same manner, though the term has other meanings in other variants of English. In American English, "railcar" is a generic term for a railway [[automobiles|vehicle]]; in other countries "railcar" refers specifically to a self-propelled, powered, railway [[automobiles|vehicle]].
>
> Although some [[automobiles|cars]] exist for the railroad's own use–for track maintenance purposes, for example–most carry a revenue-earning load of [[passengers|passengers]] or [[cargo|freight]], and may be classified accordingly as [[passengers|passenger]] [[automobiles|cars]] or coaches on the one hand or [[cargo|freight]] [[automobiles|cars]] (or wagons) on the other.
