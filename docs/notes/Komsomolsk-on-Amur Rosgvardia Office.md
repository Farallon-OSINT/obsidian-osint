a guerrilla attack was launched against the Rosgvardia office in [[Maps/Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Khabarovsk Krai, Far Eastern Federal District, Russia430.3526436163887|Komsomolsk-on-Amur]]. The plan by the guerrilla militant was ambitious: as Baza reports, the daredevil wanted to get into the Rosgvardiya [1] building itself in order to ignite a canister with flammable liquid inside. The door was closed, so the guerrilla fighter set the canister on [[fire|fire]] on the porch. A [[fire|fire]] broke out. one partisan was [[arrested|arrested]]. His name is Vladimir Zolotorev and he is 50 years old. [[activism|Anarchist]] Fighter added “Note that a canister with a flammable liquid burns just as well as a Molotov. In addition, a fuse or simple detonator can be attached to a canister (or even several canisters tied together), which delays the moment of ignition for some time and thus greatly increases the chances of a safe getaway for the guerrillas,” in their Telegram post.
