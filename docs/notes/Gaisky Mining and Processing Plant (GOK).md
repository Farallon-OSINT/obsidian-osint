Jury still out on cause/intention. Russia is the world’s sixth-largest coal producer Nearly 34% out of 58 coal mines in Russia are vulnerable and dangerous, and are reported of neglect and safety breaches. working conditions in the former Soviet Union are appalling and miners were forced to cut corners on safety and work in a dangerous environment for the sake of "productivity". Underground miners in Russia’s coal industry are paid 15,000 rubles ($575) while 70% of income is handed as “bonuses” which makes working conditions for the laborers worse.
