Ostankovichi-Zhardy section of the [[Maps/Homyel, Homyel Region, Belarus|Gomel]] branch of the Belarusian Railways, the relay cabinet of signaling, centralization and blocking (SCB) was [[fire|burned]], and as a result, traffic lights and switches on this section were put into non-working. The Ostankovichi - Zherd section is located on the Zhlobin - Kalinkovichi line, which then continues to Ovruch (Zhytomyr region of Ukraine). The line was built as the shortest path for military echelons towards Ukraine during the First World War.
