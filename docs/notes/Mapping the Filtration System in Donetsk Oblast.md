Mapping the [[Camps|Filtration System]] in Donetsk Oblast

Introduction  
For many people in newly-occupied areas of Donetsk oblast, their most intimate interaction with Russia's occupying forces and their proxies comes as they pass through what the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab (Yale HRL) report has identified as a [[Camps|filtration system]]. This [[Camps|filtration system]] is the physical infrastructure and process used to register, interrogate, and detain Ukrainian civilians, prisoners of war, and others in areas Russia and its proxies occupy.

There is evidence that the system was created weeks before the invasion began and likely grew following Russia’s capture of Mariupol in April 2022 to accommodate [[Camps|filtration]] of all citizens. Occupying powers in international conflicts have the right to register persons within their area of control; the force in control may even detain civilians in certain limited circumstances. However, Russia’s apparent [[Camps|filtration system]] for persons within Donetsk oblast, which includes use of [[Camps|extrajudicial]] and incommunicado [[Camps|detention]], violates multiple elements of international humanitarian law and raises multiple potentially grave human rights issues.

Combining open-source information with very high-resolution satellite imagery, Yale HRL is able to present the most comprehensive public assessment to date of this large-scale apparatus of screening and [[Camps|extrajudicial]] [[Camps|detention]].

Overall Findings  
Yale HRL's report offers four key findings:

Russia and Russia-aligned forces operate at least 21 facilities in and around Donetsk oblast that are part of the [[Camps|filtration]] system;  
There appear to be four types of facilities involved in [[Camps|filtration]]: (1) registration, (2) holding, (3) secondary interrogation, and (4) [[Camps|detention]];  
Disturbed earth consistent with potential graves is present at Volnovakha Correctional Colony № 120 near Olenivka, Volnovakha raion during two time periods. The same correctional colony was the location of the 29 July 2022 explosion that allegedly killed 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs);  
The appearance of disturbed earth sites in satellite imagery pre-dates the explosion. One area of disturbed earth was observed in imagery from 11 April 2022. This apparent disturbed earth is contemporaneous with an open source account of alleged gravedigging. Disturbed earth then appeared in a second location by 27 July 2022.
