[[Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia|Ivanovo]] subscribers also sent a "paintographic" story of the slogan at a heat point on Kohomskoye [[roads|highway]]. It's not the first time that the inscription is covered with gray paint. The slogan persistently reappears.  
Kohomskoye highway, [[Ivanovo|Ivanovo]]
