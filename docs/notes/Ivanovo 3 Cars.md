[[Maps/Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Central Federal District, 153000, Russia|Ivanovo]]

Note - [[fire|Burning]] [[automobiles|cars]] does not seem to be rare in Russia. These [[automobiles|cars]] were said elsewhere to have had Z iconography. It is also possible they were [[fire|burned]] as part of the Heavy Machine Tool Plant [[fire|fire]] in the same area on the same day.
