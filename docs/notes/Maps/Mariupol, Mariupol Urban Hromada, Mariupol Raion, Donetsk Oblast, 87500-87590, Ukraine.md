[[Pro-Russian|Pro-Russian]] troops at the [[Maps/Russia|Russian]]-controlled [[Camps|camp]] for Ukrainians in Bezimenne, 11 miles east of Mariupol. It can be revealed this is the first point in a chain of [[Camps|camps]] that stretches all the way to [[Russia|Russia]]’s Pacific coast.

> **mariupol** (UK: , US: (listen); Ukrainian: Маріу́поль [mɐr⁽ʲ⁾iˈupolʲ] (listen); Russian: Мариу́поль [mərʲɪˈupəlʲ]) is a city on the north coast of the Sea of Azov at the mouth of the Kalmius river, in the Pryazovia region of Ukraine. Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and its capture by Russia, it was the tenth-largest city in Ukraine and the second-largest in Donetsk Oblast, with an estimated population of 431,859, according to a 2021 census estimate. Following its capture, the population is now, according to Ukrainian authorities, estimated to be less than 100,000.Not only was Mariupol a centre for trade and manufacturing, it also played a key role in the development of higher education and various other businesses as well as being a Black Sea coast resort area. From 1948 to 1989, the city was named Zhdanov, after the Soviet functionary Andrei Zhdanov, as part of the practice of renaming cities after Communist leaders. Mariupol was founded on the site of a former Cossack encampment known as Kalmius, and granted city rights in 1778. Mariupol played a key role in the industrialization of Ukraine, and was a centre for the grain trade, metallurgy, and heavy engineering, including the Illich Steel & Iron Works and Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.

> In 2022, the city was besieged by Russian and pro-Russian proxy forces and largely destroyed, for which it received the title of Hero City of Ukraine. On 16 May 2022, the last remaining Ukrainian troops in Azovstal Steel Plant surrendered as Russia secured complete control over the city.

The Mariupol mayor’s office reports that four [[Camps|filtration camps]] are operating in the city.  The accounts of these [[Camps|camps]] are harrowing.  An escapee from Mariupol described the experience as follows: “The [[Camps|filtration camps]] are like ghettos,” she said.  “Russians divide people into groups. Those who were suspected of having connections with the Ukrainian army, territorial defense, journalists, workers from the government – it’s very dangerous for them.  They take those people to prisons to Donetsk, torture them.”

Colleagues, what these reports describe brings back horrific memories of a bygone era.  Invading a neighboring country, removing its legitimately elected government, herding its population into “[[Camps|filtration camps]]", and holding sham referenda in a transparent attempt to cover its aggression with a false veneer of legitimacy is a wholly barbaric enterprise.
