There was concern among Soviet leaders that citizens that had been outside the supervision of the government and security services may need screening to ensure their political loyalty. By the end of World War II they handled screening of all people from the Soviet territories occupied by Nazi Germany. The NKVD special-purpose camps were established by NKVD Order No. 001735 of December 28, 1941, titled "–û —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–∏ —Å–ø–µ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä–µ–π –¥–ª—è –±—ã–≤—à–∏—Ö –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å–ª—É–∂–∞—â–∏—Ö –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏, –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è –≤ –ø–ª–µ–Ω—É –∏ –≤ –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∏–∫–∞" ("On the establishment of special camps for former soldiers of the Red Army who were in captivity, or were surrounded by the enemy"). By NKVD Order No. 00100 of February 20, 1945, they were renamed to "–ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–æ—á–Ω–æ-—Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ª–∞–≥–µ—Ä—è" ("verification and filtration camps"). Surviving POWs (about 1.5 million), repatriated Ostarbeiter, and other displaced persons totaling more than 4,000,000 people were sent to special NKVD filtration camps (distinct from the [[prison|Gulags]]).
