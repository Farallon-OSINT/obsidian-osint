> The grey-zone (also grey zone, gray zone, and gray-zone) describes the space in between [[anti-war|peace]] and war in which state and non-state actors engage in competition.  
> Use of the term _grey-zone_ is widespread in national security circles, but there is no universal agreement on the definition of _grey-zone_, or even whether it is a useful term, with views about the term ranging from "faddish" or "vague", to "useful" or "brilliant".

The grey-zone is defined as "competitive interactions among and within state and non-state actors that fall between the traditional war and [[anti-war|peace]] duality." by the United States Special Operations Command.

A key element of operations within the grey-zone is that they remain below the threshold of an attack which could have a legitimate conventional military response (jus ad bellum).

One paper defined it as "coercive statecraft actions short of war", and a "mainly non-military domain of human activity in which states use national resources to deliberately coerce other states".

The Center for Strategic and International Studies defines the grey-zone as "the contested arena somewhere between routine statecraft and open warfare."

British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace called the grey-zone "that limbo land between [[anti-war|peace]] and war."
