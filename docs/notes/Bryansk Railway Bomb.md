Other date 26 April, 2022. Used earliest reported date. April 23, a hand-made bomb was found in a relay cabinet of the Bryansk railway. Experts came to the conclusion that in the relay cabinet there was an incendiary-type IED with a timer and a battery connected, presumably, to containers with gasoline. Traces of breaking into the relay cabinet, which is locked with a special key, were not found. The shift electrician who found the gift says he saw a suspicious man on a motorcycle in the forest near the site.
