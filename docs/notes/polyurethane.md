> **polyurethane** (; often abbreviated PUR and PU) refers to a class of polymers composed of organic units joined by carbamate (urethane) links. In contrast to other common polymers such as polyethylene and polystyrene, polyurethane is produced from a wide range of starting materials. This chemical variety produces polyurethanes with different chemical structures leading to many different applications. These include rigid and flexible foams, [[varnishes|varnishes]] and [[coatings|coatings]], [[adhesives|adhesives]], electrical potting compounds, and fibers such as spandex and PUL. [[Foams|Foams]] are the largest application accounting for 67% of all polyurethane produced in 2016. A polyurethane is typically produced by reacting an isocyanate with a polyol. Since a polyurethane contains two types of monomers, which polymerize one after the other, they are classed as alternating copolymers. Both the isocyanates and polyols used to make a polyurethane contain two or more functional groups per molecule.

> Global production in 2019 was 25 million metric tonnes, accounting for about 6% of all polymers produced in that year. Polyurethane is a commodity plastic.
