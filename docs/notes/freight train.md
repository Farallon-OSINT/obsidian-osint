> Rail [[cargo|freight]] transport is the use of railroads and trains to transport [[cargo|cargo]] as opposed to human [[passengers|passengers]].
>
> A **freight train**, [[cargo|cargo]] train, or goods train is a group of freight [[automobiles|cars]] (US) or goods wagons (International Union of Railways) hauled by one or more locomotives on a railway, transporting [[cargo|cargo]] all or some of the way between the shipper and the intended destination as part of the logistics chain. Trains may haul bulk material, intermodal containers, general [[cargo|freight]] or specialized [[cargo|freight]] in purpose-designed [[automobiles|cars]]. Rail [[cargo|freight]] practices and economics vary by country and region.

> When considered in terms of ton-miles or tonne-kilometers hauled per unit of energy consumed, rail transport can be more efficient than other means of transportation. Maximum economies are typically realized with bulk commodities (e.g., coal), especially when hauled over long distances. However, shipment by rail is not as flexible as by the [[roads|highway]], which has resulted in much [[cargo|freight]] being hauled by [[automobiles|truck]], even over long distances. Moving goods by rail often involves transshipment costs, particularly when the shipper or receiver lack direct rail access. These costs may exceed that of operating the train itself, a factor that practices such as containerization, trailer-on-[[railway car|flatcar]] or rolling [[roads|highway]] aim to minimize.
