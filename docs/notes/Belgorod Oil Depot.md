Fireballs rise over an oil depot in [[Maps/Belgorod, Belgorodsky District, Belgorod Oblast, Central Federal District, Russia|Belgorod]], a Russian city located 30 kilometers from the border with Ukraine, on April 1. According to a local official, the [[fire|fire]] was caused by an [[air|air]] strike from two Ukrainian [[aircraft|helicopters]]. Video of the aftermath of the dawn incident shows two Hind [[aircraft|helicopter]] gunships skimming the rooftops of the southwestern Russian city. Ukraine denied any involvement.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine denied the statement of the Russian Federation and replied that our defenders had nothing to do with the emergency in [[Maps/Belgorod, Belgorodsky District, Belgorod Oblast, Central Federal District, Russia|Belgorod]]. High-ranking officials named two probable reasons for undermining the oil depot–the carelessness of the invaders or an attempt to hide someone’s corruption. On April 1, Russian media reported that a projectile allegedly “fired from Ukraine” fell in the [[Maps/Belgorod Oblast, Central Federal District, Russia|Belgorod region]]. As a result of the explosion, a [[fire|fire]] broke out at the oil depot, which destroyed several oil tanks. https://globalhappenings.com/top-global-news/217932.html according to Russian governor Vyacheslav Gladkov and an unnamed US official, two Ukrainian Mi-24 [[aircraft|Helicopters]] attacked and set [[fire|fire]] to a fuel depot in [[Maps/Belgorod, Belgorodsky District, Belgorod Oblast, Central Federal District, Russia|Belgorod]], Russia in a low-altitude airstrike with no reported casualties. Ukraine denied and dismissed this event on Russian territory as Russian propaganda. Ukrainian security official Oleksiy Danilov denied Ukraine was behind the [[aircraft|helicopter]] attack with a joke in which he blamed the "[[Maps/Belgorod, Belgorodsky District, Belgorod Oblast, Central Federal District, Russia|People's Republic of Belgorod]]" instead.
