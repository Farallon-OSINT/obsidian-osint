The city is effectively sealed off from the world, and information about what is happening inside is difficult to confirm independently. But the pair, and others, have given chilling accounts of life in Russia's so-called filtration camps, set up outside Mariupol to house civilians before they are evacuated. Oleksandr and Olena, speaking from the relatively safe western city of Lviv, say they ended up at one of the centres when they tried to escape the city. After walking from their home to an evacuation point, they were driven to a Russian refugee hub at a former school in the village of Nikolske, north-west of Mariupol. \"It was like a true concentration camp,\" Oleksandr, 49, says. The centres have been compared by Ukrainian officials to those used during Russia's war in Chechnya, when thousands of Chechens were brutally interrogated and many disappeared. Oleksandr and Olena were fingerprinted, photographed from all sides, and interrogated for several hours by Russian security officers - \"like in a prison\", he says. They worried that the Russians would look at their phones, and so they cleared all evidence from their devices of anything to do with Ukraine - including photos of their daughter in front of a Ukrainian flag. They were right to worry. Oleksandr says that during their interrogation, Russian security officers examined photographs, phone call history and contact numbers on their devices for links with journalists or government and military officials. \"If a person was suspected of being a 'Ukrainian Nazi', they took them to Donetsk for further investigation or murder,\" says Oleksandr, although the BBC has not been able to verify this claim. \"It was very dangerous and risky. Any small doubt, any small resistance - and they could take you to the basements for interrogation and torture. Everybody was afraid to be taken to Donetsk.\" President Vladimir Putin has stated one of the aims of his invasion is to clear Ukraine of Nazis, and Russian propaganda has made numerous baseless allegations that Ukraine is somehow aligned with Nazism. Eventually the pair were detained and put on a list for evacuation. But the ordeal did not stop there. A secret escape \u00b6 Elderly people slept in corridors without mattresses or blankets, Olena says. There was only one toilet and one sink for thousands of people. Dysentery soon began to spread. \"There was no way to wash or clean,\" she says. \"It smelt extremely awful.\" Soap and disinfectant ran out on the second day they were there. Soon, too, did toilet paper and sanitary pads. Olena and Oleksandr were told they had permission to leave on the 148th evacuation bus. But a week later, just 20 buses had left the facility. In contrast, there were many buses organised to go to Russian territory. Authorities even tried to force the couple on to a coach heading east, they say. In the end Olena and Oleksandr felt compelled to seek the help of private drivers, who they feared could be Russians or collaborators. \"We didn't have any choice - either be forcibly deported to Russia or risk it with these private drivers,\" Olena says. It's a dilemma that Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, recognises. \"Many buses of civilians go to Russian rather than Ukrainian territory,\" he told the BBC, over the phone. \"From the beginning of war, [the Russians] didn't allow any way to evacuate civilians. It's a direct military order to kill civilians,\" he claimed. Oleksandr and Olena's driver managed to get them from their filtration camp to the Russian-occupied city of Berdyansk - through \"fields, dirt roads, narrow pathways behind all the checkpoints\", Olena says, because they didn't have the proper documents to pass a Russian inspection. They then spent three days looking for a route out before finding another driver who was willing to risk everything to get them to Ukrainian-controlled territory. He managed to get around 12 Russian checkpoints and safely deliver them to Zaporizhzhia. The couple then took an overnight train to Lviv. \"From filtration camps you can only escape using these risky local private drivers,\" Oleksandr says. \"Fortunately, there are good people among them.\" Camps like 'ghettos' \u00b6 Arriving in Lviv on the same day were Valentyna and her husband Evgeniy. They also managed to flee Mariupol last week. They were boarding a coach to a smaller city in western Ukraine - desperate for safety after their ordeal. The situation in Mariupol, they said, had become dire. They survived by sheltering in a basement, living of tinned goods, a handful of potatoes they grew in their garden, and water taken from the boiler. Evgeniy and Valentyna managed to survive by hiding in their basement The filtration process was speedy for them, says Valentyna, 58, perhaps because of their age and because Evgeniy has a disability. But it was far worse for younger people, she said. \"The filtration camps are like ghettos,\" she says. \"Russians divide people into groups. Those who were suspected of having connections with the Ukrainian army, territorial defence, journalists, workers from the government - it's very dangerous for them. They take those people to prisons to Donetsk, torture them.\" She and Evgeniy also say many were sent from the filtration camps to Russia. Sometimes people were told they were destined for Ukrainian-controlled territory, they say, only for the coach to head to Russian-held territory instead. Like Oleksandr and Olena, Valentyna says it was only because of their driver that they managed to escape. \"When we finally [escaped] and saw the Ukrainian fighters and the flag, when we heard Ukrainian language, everyone in the bus started to cry,\" she said. \"It was just unbelievable that we stayed alive and finally fled from hell.\" Both couples have now escaped Mariupol, a city that has become a symbol of the resistance and the suffering of Ukraine after the Russian invasion. Now they face an uncertain future - just four of the 11 million Ukrainians displaced by the conflict. \"The city does not exist anymore,\" Valentyna says. \"Even walls. Just huge piles of ruins.

But some employees still refused to follow such orders - and resigned from the [[authorities|authorities]]. Now some of them are part of BYPOL - in it former security forces [[investigate the crimes|investigate the crimes]] of their colleagues against protesters and lure them to their side. Medusa tells how former Belarusian [[policemen|policemen]] and [[investigators|investigators]] are trying to create an ideal [[Ministry of Internal Affairs|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. Mass protests in Belarus began on August 9, immediately after the presidential election. A week later, [[Andrei Ostapovich|Andrei Ostapovich]], a [[Minsk|Minsk]] investigator with five years of experience in the UK, resigned. In his report, he explained that he could not \"fulfill criminal orders\" and \"participate in the concealment of crimes\" by the security forces - by that time thousands of protesters had been [detained](./arrested.md) throughout Belarus, many of them were beaten and tortured . Even before his dismissal, Ostapovich repeatedly participated in protests. For example, on August 10 and 12, he himself had to run away from his colleagues in the authorities to avoid detention . On other days, he went to work actions - he went to so-called political trips, that is, he worked out reports of possible crimes at demonstrations. For example, Andrei's work had a statement that during the protests, riot police officers detained a 16-year-old young man, inserted a baton in his mouth and forced him to sing the anthem of Belarus - and after refusal beat him. Ostapovich explained to Medusa that the management did not allow him to investigate such cases - and he decided to quit. After that, he wrote a report in which he declared the \"bandit actions\" of the security forces, went to another protest, and then decided to leave Belarus. Returning home, I reread the report, thought that the text turned out to be too emotional - and it should be rewritten in a regular dismissal report. Then I went to the window and saw that the girls continued to stand at the action with flowers . I looked at people fighting, holding on, and didn't want to stand aside, I decided that I would leave everything as it is. I decided that I would leave for a week to see the situation: what will happen, how the management will react to my report and what should I do in the future. The investigator went to Moscow to visit his friends. And the next day I learned that the management, having received the report, began to look for it. Ostapovich was worried that he might be detained in Russia, after which he would be extradated to the Belarusian special services. And he contacted the Embassy of Latvia to ask for political asylum. There Ostapovich was told that it was better to negotiate this with Latvian border guards on the land border between Russia and Latvia (about nine hours drive from Moscow ). But the investigator was not allowed to do this: he was not released from Russia due to the coronavirus pandemic. Then Ostapovich went to [[Pskov|Pskov]] - there was the consulate of [[Latvia|Latvia]] closest to the border. He was told: it takes officials three days to make a decision. Meanwhile, on August 20, a criminal case was opened against the investigator under the article \"on the inaction of an official\" in [[Belarus|Belarus]]. And two days later, Ostapovich was detained in a Pskov hotel and a protocol on petty hooliganism was drawn up against him - allegedly he was swearing in a public place. \"This is done when it is necessary to hold a person, a standard approach. At the same time, I was detained in a room that is not a public place, and there was no motherhood there in principle,\" Ostapovich explains. The investigator was taken from the hotel to the police department, where Ostapovich was informed: they were \"interested in the FSB.\" In the police, the Belarusian spent about a day - then he was taken out through an emergency exit, which already had six or eight masked people. All things were taken away from Andrei, a ski mask and handcuffs were handcuffed, to which the kettlebell was attached. And they got into the minibus. \"Sometimes the thought swept through my head that I was being taken to throw into some river. I didn't understand what was going on. What weights are in the 21st century? I used to see this only in the movies. Psychological pressure was enormous. The security forces demanded a phone password to allegedly turn off geolocation, but all four hours of the road I didn't say a word. By sound, I tried to figure out where we were going. When passing trucks were heard one by one, I realized that we were going towards the border,\" said the former investigator. Ostapovich's car was already taken out on the territory of Belarus - in the Vitebsk region. There was also a notification that he was deported from Russia for \"illegal detention of Russian citizens.\" The investigator was explained that these citizens are Wagner PMC fighters detained in Belarus shortly before the elections. The Minsk investigator had nothing to do with their detention - he himself assumes that it was just a formal reason to return him to Belarus. A few minutes after disembarking from the minibus, another bus arrived at the site. Inside, Andrei noticed men who looked like law enforcement officers - presumably, they were KGB officers. Ostapovich did not wait for them - and fled to the forest. \"There was a moment when I hid and the people who ran after me walked literally a few meters away. I was lying in the grass, I was wearing a light shirt, and at that moment it seemed to me that it was literally glowing. I lay for about an hour, it always seemed that they were still watching me. At one point, I gathered my strength and decided to run further,\" Ostapovich explained. He spent about two weeks on the run. Sometimes, according to him, you had to walk more than 70 kilometers a day and drink water from streams. Wild animals met on the way more than once: \"As a child, I was told stories that if you meet a wild boar in the forest, you can seriously suffer. I remembered it when I saw their traces on earth. A moment later, a wild boar ran out of the bushes, and I, fortunately, managed to light up his eyes and run away.\" With such runs, Ostapovich managed to run to the border with \"one of the EU countries\" (he does not call it). He crossed the border itself by swimming. On the other side of the border, Andrei ran further, and having reached civilization, he withdrew the last 480 euros from the card - the investigator bought a phone and a SIM card with them, and also paid for several nights in a hotel. \"Disclosure of crimes against the Belarusian people\" \u00b6 Now Ostapovich is in Poland - he forms political asylum and lives in Warsaw, where he founded the BYPOL project. The former investigator decided to help the security forces, who, like him, were persecuted because of their political views. Initially (as in August) a similar project was tried to be developed by a Belarusian businessman living in the United States, Mikita Mikado - he offered financial assistance to all security forces who refused to comply with orders to violence against protesters. However, he decided to suspend the project after several employees of his company PandaDoc were [arrested](./arrested.md) in Minsk. The official date of creation of BYPOL is considered to be October 20, 2020, when former presidential candidate of Belarus Svetlana Tikhanovskaya (the opposition believes that she lost the elections only because of falsifications) met in Warsaw with several Belarusian security forces who left the service due to disagreement with Lukashenko's policy. Ostapovich was also at the meeting. \"After the meeting with Tikhanovskaya, more and more people began to address us. When a fairly strong team was formed, it became clear that our activities could not be limited to helping employees [bodies]. We have begun to engage in investigations and operational work related to the disclosure of crimes against the Belarusian people,\" says Ostapovich. The Belarusian diaspora and the BySol solidarity fund, which raises funds for the affected Belarusians, helped to purchase the equipment necessary for BYPOL's work. Ostapovich claims that now the project exists both at the expense of the help of diasporas and with the participants' own money. He did not disclose the total budget of the project. BYPOL works in several offices in Poland and other EU countries, where former employees of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Investigative Committee and the prosecutor's office, as well as volunteers are looking for new supporters and processing the incoming data. Any representative of Belarusian law enforcement agencies can contact the telegram channel of the organization. BYPOL, in turn, offers assistance to such security forces. The organization also helps to leave the country - through Russia to Ukraine or EU countries. In total, BYPOL helped about 30 former security forces leave. At the same time, the project staff maintain special lists of applied security forces. They are recorded in a special \"book\" of employees who \"fight for the truth\" - now there are more than 500 people in it. In turn, these security forces tell BYPOL about what is now happening in the bodies. They manage to get other \"unique information\" by hacking state databases, admit to BYPOL, IT specialists cooperating with the organization help to do so. According to Ostapovich, it is not difficult to hack these bases. In addition, BYPOL works in conjunction with other public projects that appeared in the wake of protests. For example, with project 23.34 , where the protesters themselves talk about their detentions, and the \"Unified Crime Registration Book\" ( ECRP ), where everyone can download information about the crime by the security forces. All this information, according to him, helps to identify the perpetrators among the current employees of the bodies. \"We own a certain amount of information ourselves, plus we have the skills to analyze information from open sources. In addition, the data is transmitted to us by employees working in the field. We analyze all this, compare it, establish a chain of events and look for the guilty,\" Ostapovich explained to Medusa. Lists of security forces who, according to the project staff, are guilty of crimes against protesters, BYPOL, with the mediation of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, transmits to EU representatives. Ostapovich explained to Medusa that this could lead both to personal sanctions against individual security forces and to the international isolation of the power bloc of Belarus - for example, to problems with the supply of special means. For example, light noise grenades, which were used in the acceleration of demonstrations in Minsk, were produced in the Czech Republic. \"Now we understand that if you rock the agenda for the security forces, the rest of the apparatus that exists will quickly fall. Lukashenko himself admitted at his meeting with the riot police that until the last of them tells him to leave, he will not leave,\" said Yevgeny Medvedev, PR and GR manager of BYPOL, in a conversation with Medusa. Italian security strike \u00b6 BYPOL claims that the project has information about more than a thousand crimes by Belarusian security forces. On December 20, the project published the first 28 materials - it included cases of election fraud, torture and beatings. In addition, a list of persons listened to by the Ministry of Internal Affairs was made publicly available. 89 names got into it. Including at least 39 active (and former) teachers and students of Minsk State Linguistic University (MSLU). WHY THIS UNIVERSITY? \u00b6 Lukashenko demanded to expel students who participate in protests from universities \"We took part in unauthorized actions under non-state symbols.\" Participants of the student demonstration were [detained](./arrested.md) in Minsk According to Yevgeny Medvedev's forecast, the project will produce more and more such materials. The number of security forces cooperating with him will also grow. According to him, now in many Belarusian law enforcement agencies employees are sabotaging work or moving on to Italian strikes - that is, they work, strictly observing the rules and obligations. This greatly limits the work of departments - and interferes with the work of the current government. Evgeny Medvedev What is happening today is the gradual degradation and disintegration of law enforcement agencies. Our task is to make it happen quickly and as painfully as possible for the security forces inside, but at the same time painless for society. BYPOL emphasizes that the heads of departments, not ordinary employees who followed orders, are primarily guilty of the cruelty of the security forces. At the same time, quite successful employees also take the side of the project. Igor Loban is a former investigator for particularly important cases of the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee for the Grodno region, Major of Justice. He was one of the first to join BYPOL - immediately after he was sent to initiate criminal proceedings against protesters in early August. Having received such an order, Loban just turned off the phone and left the service. He also posted an appeal on Instagram to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Belarus Yuri Karaev (later dismissed ), in which he criticized the actions of the security forces. \"10 minutes after my appeal, my managers started calling me. They said they were already leaving for me. I hid for a few days, but my comrades from the KGB reported that they were going to open a criminal case against me. Then I moved to Poland,\" Loban told Medusa. In Warsaw, Loban met with Ostapovich - and joined his project. Among the areas of BYPOL's work, the former investigator for particularly important cases notes the receipt of audio and video from existing employees. For example, on the YouTube channel of the project you can watch videos recorded on the chest chambers of Belarusian security forces. They show how detainees were treated in paddy wagons and what happened in the police departments. The last video on the channel was published on December 18. The action takes place on August 12 in one of the police department of Minsk. The people on the video, including minors and women, are in the gym of the department. Some stand along the wall on their knees facing the floor, their hands are tied behind their backs, someone is lying on the floor. People are beaten, screams are heard. According to Loban, such actions are supported by a minority of security forces - mainly employees of the riot police and other similar structures. According to him, in some units about 70% of employees have already contacted BYPOL. All communication with them takes place in secure messengers. Igor Loban In the age of information technology, we have ways of conspiracy, and we do not worry that our sources can be disclosed. In order for the leak, the authorities will have to agree with [the creator of the Telegram messenger] Pavel Durov, which, in our opinion, is simply unrealistic. Andrei Ostapovich in a conversation with Medusa also admitted that the Belarusian security forces are now actively trying to figure out their colleagues cooperating with his project - but so far there have been no such cases. Another member of BYPOL - former senior operative of the Main Department of Internal Affairs of the Minsk City Executive Committee Matvey Kupreychik - stressed that high-ranking security forces are not afraid to contact the project. Thanks to this, on December 28, the project managed to publish an audio recording of the alleged conversation of former Interior Minister Karaev about the political component of the case of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's husband Sergei. Among other things, the voice on the recording, allegedly belonging to Karaev, calls Tikhanov \"destroyor of the state\" and \"creature\". WHO IS SERGEI TICHANOVSKY? \u00b6 Alexander Lukashenko's election competitor is the wife of the [arrested](./arrested.md) blogger. Her campaign is held under the slogan \"Stop cockroach\", and with success \"We broke into the apartment, put a gun to my head.\" \u00b6 Vladimir Zhigar is a former operative of the criminal investigation department of the Mozyr police department, police lieutenant. Even before the elections, he resigned from the authorities, participated in many rallies, several times was among the people who guarded Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. On August 10, Zhigar was detained in his apartment by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. \"They broke into the apartment, put a gun to my head and to the heads of my comrades who were with me at that time. After that, we were taken away and handed over to the riot police,\" Vladimir told Meduza. Despite the fact that the detention took place in the apartment, the protocol stated that Vladimir was walking along Pobediteley Avenue in Minsk and shouted \"anti-state slogans,\" he added. Now Zhigar, like many former Belarusian security forces, is located in Poland and is engaged in the development of BYPOL. Among other things, the preparation of a reform of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, on which the project is working together with one of the representative bodies of the opposition, the National Anti-Crisis Directorate (NAU). It is headed by former Minister of Culture Pavel Latushko - until August 2020 he headed the Yanka Kupala Theater, but was fired after the protests began. INTERVIEW WITH LATUSHKO \u00b6 \"We are not the opposition. We are the majority\" Pavel Latushko was the Minister of Culture of Belarus, then headed the leading theater of the country, became an active participant in the protests - and he was fired. We talked to him The proposed reform of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in NAU is supervised by Svetlana Khilko - she herself graduated from the Academy of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs and worked in law enforcement agencies for five years. In 2012, Khilko resigned from SK with the rank of captain, moved to the United States and began working in the field of IT. And when the mass protests began, she wanted to help the demonstrators and entered the NAU. She had the idea of reform in the autumn of 2020. According to her, by that time it was already clear that without such a reform, the Ministry of Internal Affairs simply could not exist, as it had turned into a system of political investigation and \"suppression of will\" of Belarusians. Khilko explained to Medusa that about 20 people are involved in the work on the reform (not counting third-party consultants) and its principles have already been formulated. Most importantly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs should return to the protection of the rights of ordinary citizens and establish communication with people. According to NAU, this can be facilitated, among other things, by the renaming of the police into the police. Another important point is the decentralization of the department, after which the police of any city will not be directly controlled only by the Minister of the Interior. Svetlana Khilko Now law enforcement officers lack a sense of responsibility. They say that they received an order from above, but few people understand that everyone is responsible for making decisions. There have already been examples in Belarus when policemen stopped dispersing peaceful demonstrators. People on the spot have to decide for themselves how they will live. WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA? \u00b6 We know that the law enforcement system in Russia is rotten. But how did it happen - and what to do about it? All important questions are answered by sociologist Kirill Titayev While the oppositionists are preparing to create a new Ministry of Internal Affairs, the old one, according to their data, has already faced a large-scale staff leak. On January 6, BYPOL published an internal analytical review of the staffing of the Ministry of Internal Affairs system for the first nine months of 2020. The author of the secret document is the head of the department for coordination and interaction of personnel units and ideological work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Colonel Alexander Mazur. Within the first nine months of 2020, 2,091 employees resigned from the department, while in the third quarter, when protests began in the country, there were more than half of the dismissals - 1,074 people. According to BYPOL, by the beginning of 2021, there were even more resigned - many security forces had contracts ended on December 31, a significant part of them refused to renew the contract with the state (the exact number of employees who refused to extend contracts in BYPOL plans to be named later). However, according to the project, now the Belarusian authorities are actively preparing for the onset of spring and the continuation of mass protests: they are purchasing weapons, bulletproof vests and special means. Matvey Kupreychik in a conversation with Medusa noted that this may not help in conditions of shortages. \"As soon as it gets warmer, people will start going out en masse again. And now all factors say that it will be much more difficult to suppress a new wave of protest to the authorities and the power bloc than in August,\" Kupreychik is sure.

Its participants called it their goal to search for information about those involved in repression. \"Cyber guerrillas\" gained access to the database of security forces, began to hack the websites of government agencies and were remembered by a number of symbolic actions - for example, they showed a video of beating protesters on the air of Belarusian state channels and included Lukashenko in the list of wanted on the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus. In the future, the CyberPartisans continued to hack, but their actions did not receive a wide resonance. And at the end of July 2021, the group announced Operation Heat, which it called the largest cyber attack in the history of Belarus. After that, hackers began to publish information compromising Belarusian law enforcement agencies almost every day. Medusa tells what kind of information it is, how it was managed to get it, what consequences their leakage may have and how the current Belarusian authorities react to it. Over the past month, \"Cyberpartisans\" told about the hacking of numerous bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs - and showed fragments from them \u00b6 On July 26, the group announced access to the automated information system (AIS) \"GAI-Center\", which contains information about registered vehicles . \"Cyberpartisans\" posted photos of Belarusian officials, probably taken during the registration of a driver's license, and also published information about the accident with the participation of the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Olga Chemodanova. On July 27, \"Cyberpartisans\" said that they had received information from the AIS \"Passport\", which is used by passport and visa units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus. They posted passport details of Lukashenko himself, his sons Victor, Dmitry and Nikolai, as well as photos of Nikolai and his alleged mother Irina Abelskaya, who used to be Lukashenko's personal doctor. On July 28, Cyberpartisans published fragments of documents with information about people who allegedly called the police and reported the whereabouts of the protesters. This information was obtained as a result of hacking into the 102 service database, hackers said. On July 29, the group announced the hacking of the base of the Department of its own security (USB) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus and published information about people who, judging by the documents, work in GUBOPIK and OMON - units that actively participated in suppressing protests. On July 30, hackers showed two videos from protest actions made from above and told about the hacking of the server, where \"videos of operational drones of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\" are stored. On the same day, \"Cyberpartisans\" told about the hacking of surveillance cameras in an detention center on Okrestina in Minsk, where protesters were beaten and tortured . And the next day they announced a \"fatal blow to the system of speed recording and surveillance cameras.\" On August 4, \"Cyberpartisans\" allegedly posted information from the database of the Main Directorate of Personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. On August 5, they published data on positive tests for coronavirus from the hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. On August 8, hackers showed fragments of data from the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs \"Besporyadki\", where, apparently, information about the detainees at the protests was collected. On August 26, the telegram channel \"Cyberpartizan\" reported that the database of employees of the Investigative Committee of Belarus was hacked. These publications did not contain complete data to which, according to Cyberpartisans, they gained access - only fragments. At the same time, in some fragments hackers concealed personal data (when it came to the defendants in the \"Conversary\" database), and in others they left them open (when it came to law enforcement officers and \"scausers\"). \"Cyberpartisans\" also stated that these security forces will get into telegram channels and sites that publish personal information about those involved in the repression in Belarus. Based on Cyberpartizan plums, journalists calculated excess mortality during the pandemic in Belarus \u00b6 Whether Cyberpartisan really has access to the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is impossible to fully check. However, journalists of Zerkalo.io and \"Present Time\" asked for personal data about themselves or their acquaintances who agreed to participate in the experiment as evidence. In one case, Cyberpartisans sent data from AIS \"GAI-Center\", in another - from AIS \"Passport\". In both cases, the data coincided. In addition, \"Cyberpartisans\" shared with \"Present Time\" an array of personal data of 1.4 million residents of Belarus who died from January 2010 to March 2021 from AIS \"Passport\". Based on these data, journalists calculated excess mortality during the pandemic in Belarus. They came to the conclusion that from March 2020 to March 2021, this figure amounted to 32 thousand people - 14.4 times more than the authorities reported. Experts interviewed by \"Present Time\" said that this conclusion coincides with the conclusions based on previous leaks about deaths in Belarus, and noted that this makes the country one of the most affected countries in Europe. Hackers posted conversations between high-ranking police officers. One of them directly entrusted the \" * \" to the protesters \u00b6 In addition, \"Cyberpartisans\" announced the hacking of DOORD - the department for ensuring the operational and investigative activities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the databases of which audio recordings of wiretapping conversations on mobile phones are stored - and from August 9 to 21 published six audio recordings with conversations of high-ranking police officers of Minsk Three audio recordings are conversations between Lukashenko spokesman Natalia Eismont and Minsk riot police commander Dmitry Balaba. All conversations allegedly took place on November 2, 2020 - around this time, Eismont, according to previously published data , went to cut off white-red-white ribbons in the protest courtyards of Minsk. In a conversation with Balaba, she discusses one of these trips. Eismont says that she and her companions did not meet the protesters, and calls on them to \"stretch somehow.\" Balaba offers to arrange a \"wagon hunt.\" \"Ribs are secondary. We need heads,\" says Eismont. Balaba wishes her a \"successful hunt\" goodbye. Two more audio recordings are, according to Cyberpartisans, conversations between Nikolai Maksimovich, Deputy Head of the Public Security Police Department of Internal Affairs of the Minsk Regional Executive Committee. They took place on August 11, 2020, on the third day of protests. Maksimovich instructs interlocutors how the police should behave with the protesters. That's what he says to one interlocutor, the head of the police from the district city of Soligorsk (here and further his quotes are given with small abbreviations). The group drove up, * , detained everyone, , into the courtyard, , everyone lying down, , everyone should feel it. Detentions - I say right away, this is my order - should be, , tough. I looked wrong, with the phone, , everyone *, , don't be ashamed of anyone. Understood?

Cyberpartisans are cooperating with the initiative of former Belarusian BYPOL security forces. They help hackers with access to the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs \u00b6 Against the background of the plums of the last month, Western media began to write about Cyberpartisan - in particular, Bloomberg and MIT Technology Review . \"Cyberpartisans\" said that there are 15 people in the group, of whom three or four are actually engaged in hacking, the rest analyze the data obtained and perform other tasks. \"Cyberpartisans\" claim that there are no professional hackers among them; most are IT industry employees, some used to be engaged in penetration testing. This is the name of the method of assessing the security of information systems through cyber attack modeling. In December 2020, Cyberpartisans contacted the opposition initiative BYPOL, which was organized by former Belarusian security forces after the start of protests in Belarus. Hackers offered them to act together, said a representative of BYPOL, a former employee of the GUBOPiK of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and former teacher of the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Alexander Azarov. According to him, BYPOL helps \"Cyberpartisans\" understand the structure of the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, process the data received, identify participants in telephone conversations and get feedback from within the system about the effect of hacking. In 2021, a like-minded Cyberpartisan received physical access to a government facility in Belarus and, being inside, hacked into a computer network, said a representative of the hacker group. According to him, this helped the \"Cyberpartisans\" to further gain access to the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The stolen information includes from one to two million minutes of telephone conversations, said the participant of Cyberpartisan. The group considers its activities ethical \"in the framework of the situation in Belarus.\" According to hackers, their goal is not only to collect information about those involved in the repression, but also to paralyze the infrastructure of the current Belarusian authorities in \"moment X\" - so the group calls the moment of the beginning of the indefinite protest, promising to announce its date later. In Moment X, cyberattacks, according to the idea of Cyberpartisan, will be combined with street protests - and all this will lead to the overthrow of Lukashenko. Shortly after the beginning of drains from the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the telegram channels \"Cyberpartisan\" were recognized as \"extremist\" \u00b6 The Belarusian authorities do not directly comment on the \"Cyberpartisan\" plums. Zerkalo.io writes that in early July, the information services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs worked intermittently. The agency explained this , among other things, by the \"anomalous heat.\" However, an anonymous Belarusian IT specialist in a conversation with Zerkalo.io noted that databases are stored on servers in data centers equipped with air conditioning, so the link to the heat does not look very plausible. \"This will go down in history as \"the effect of [Minland Minister of Belarus Ivan] Kubrakov,\" Cyber Guerrillas said on July 26, the day of the announcement of Operation Heat and the draining of the first data from the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. On July 30, the head of the KGB Ivan Tertel said that the agency records \"a sharp increase in the work of foreign special services and related destructive formations.\" On August 17, Lukashenko advised the authorities to switch to paper media if they cannot protect information electronically: \"Write by hand and put it in your box.\" And on August 18, a Belarusian court recognized two telegram channels \"Cyberpartisan\" as \"extremist.\" Leaks from the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs clearly harm Belarusian security forces. But they can also harm ordinary Belarusians \u00b6 \"If the attack is confirmed, it is the largest and most successful hacking of [state systems] since 2015, when Chinese hackers hacked into the servers of the Personnel Service Department in the United States,\" Andrei Baranovich, a spokesman for the hacker group \"Ukrainian Cyber Alliance\", told \"Present Time\". \"They are so sophisticated and attack on several levels, I've only seen this in movies before,\" Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University of Canada and cyberactivism expert, told Bloomberg. The data posted by Cyberpartisans show that \"Belarusian officials knew that they were attacking innocent people and exceeding force for no reason,\" said digital security specialist from Belarus Nikolai Kvantaliani in a conversation with Bloomberg. Other experts believe that the information received by Belarusian hackers can play a role in case of trials against Lukashenko and his associates in international courts, distrust the ranks of Belarusian security forces and officials, and, on the contrary, encourage protesters. Belarusian military expert Yegor Lebedok in a conversation with Euroradio called the incident a \"loud failure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\" and said that when they get abroad, the information received by \"Cyberpartisans\" may threaten, among other things, foreign intelligence officers of Belarus. At the same time, as Lebedok emphasized, the leak from the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is dangerous not only for security forces, but also for ordinary citizens - because their data can also be disclosed. Cyberpartisans themselves assure that the data of \"not working on the mode\" people is safe: \"We store everything in encrypted form on a separate server that is isolated from the Internet.\" ANNIVERSARY OF PROTESTS IN BELARUS \u00b6 The year that Belarus changed We tried to describe it as briefly as possible. We didn't succeed \"We are much better than those on the other hand.\" We talked to some of those who participated in the protests in Belarus from the first days.

The former investigator decided to help the security forces, who, like him, were persecuted because of their political views. Initially (as in August) a similar project was tried to be developed by a Belarusian businessman living in the United States, Mikita Mikado - he offered financial assistance to all security forces who refused to comply with orders to violence against protesters. However, he decided to suspend the project after several employees of his company PandaDoc were [arrested](./arrested.md) in Minsk. The official date of creation of BYPOL is considered to be October 20, 2020, when former presidential candidate of Belarus Svetlana Tikhanovskaya (the opposition believes that she lost the elections only because of falsifications) met in Warsaw with several Belarusian security forces who left the service due to disagreement with Lukashenko's policy. Ostapovich was also at the meeting. \"After the meeting with Tikhanovskaya, more and more people began to address us. When a fairly strong team was formed, it became clear that our activities could not be limited to helping employees [bodies]. We have begun to engage in investigations and operational work related to the disclosure of crimes against the Belarusian people,\" says Ostapovich. The Belarusian diaspora and the BySol solidarity fund, which raises funds for the affected Belarusians, helped to purchase the equipment necessary for BYPOL's work. Ostapovich claims that now the project exists both at the expense of the help of diasporas and with the participants' own money. He did not disclose the total budget of the project. BYPOL works in several offices in Poland and other EU countries, where former employees of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Investigative Committee and the prosecutor's office, as well as volunteers are looking for new supporters and processing the incoming data. Any representative of Belarusian law enforcement agencies can contact the telegram channel of the organization. BYPOL, in turn, offers assistance to such security forces. The organization also helps to leave the country - through Russia to Ukraine or EU countries. In total, BYPOL helped about 30 former security forces leave. At the same time, the project staff maintain special lists of applied security forces. They are recorded in a special \"book\" of employees who \"fight for the truth\" - now there are more than 500 people in it. In turn, these security forces tell BYPOL about what is now happening in the bodies. They manage to get other \"unique information\" by hacking state databases, admit to BYPOL, IT specialists cooperating with the organization help to do so. According to Ostapovich, it is not difficult to hack these bases. In addition, BYPOL works in conjunction with other public projects that appeared in the wake of protests. For example, with project 23.34 , where the protesters themselves talk about their detentions, and the \"Unified Crime Registration Book\" ( ECRP ), where everyone can download information about the crime by the security forces. All this information, according to him, helps to identify the perpetrators among the current employees of the bodies. \"We own a certain amount of information ourselves, plus we have the skills to analyze information from open sources. In addition, the data is transmitted to us by employees working in the field. We analyze all this, compare it, establish a chain of events and look for the guilty,\" Ostapovich explained to Medusa. Lists of security forces who, according to the project staff, are guilty of crimes against protesters, BYPOL, with the mediation of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, transmits to EU representatives. Ostapovich explained to Medusa that this could lead both to personal sanctions against individual security forces and to the international isolation of the power bloc of Belarus - for example, to problems with the supply of special means. For example, light noise grenades, which were used in the acceleration of demonstrations in Minsk, were produced in the Czech Republic. \"Now we understand that if you rock the agenda for the security forces, the rest of the apparatus that exists will quickly fall. Lukashenko himself admitted at his meeting with the riot police that until the last of them tells him to leave, he will not leave,\" said Yevgeny Medvedev, PR and GR manager of BYPOL, in a conversation with Medusa.","title":"\"Disclosure of crimes against the Belarusian people\""},{"location":"notes/BYPOL/#italian-security-strike","text":"BYPOL claims that the project has information about more than a thousand crimes by Belarusian security forces.

The number of security forces cooperating with him will also grow. According to him, now in many Belarusian law enforcement agencies employees are sabotaging work or moving on to Italian strikes - that is, they work, strictly observing the rules and obligations. This greatly limits the work of departments - and interferes with the work of the current government. Evgeny Medvedev What is happening today is the gradual degradation and disintegration of law enforcement agencies. Our task is to make it happen quickly and as painfully as possible for the security forces inside, but at the same time painless for society. BYPOL emphasizes that the heads of departments, not ordinary employees who followed orders, are primarily guilty of the cruelty of the security forces. At the same time, quite successful employees also take the side of the project. Igor Loban is a former investigator for particularly important cases of the Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee for the Grodno region, Major of Justice. He was one of the first to join BYPOL - immediately after he was sent to initiate criminal proceedings against protesters in early August. Having received such an order, Loban just turned off the phone and left the service. He also posted an appeal on Instagram to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Belarus Yuri Karaev (later dismissed ), in which he criticized the actions of the security forces. \"10 minutes after my appeal, my managers started calling me. They said they were already leaving for me. I hid for a few days, but my comrades from the KGB reported that they were going to open a criminal case against me. Then I moved to Poland,\" Loban told Medusa. In Warsaw, Loban met with Ostapovich - and joined his project. Among the areas of BYPOL's work, the former investigator for particularly important cases notes the receipt of audio and video from existing employees. For example, on the YouTube channel of the project you can watch videos recorded on the chest chambers of Belarusian security forces. They show how detainees were treated in paddy wagons and what happened in the police departments. The last video on the channel was published on December 18. The action takes place on August 12 in one of the police department of Minsk. The people on the video, including minors and women, are in the gym of the department. Some stand along the wall on their knees facing the floor, their hands are tied behind their backs, someone is lying on the floor. People are beaten, screams are heard. According to Loban, such actions are supported by a minority of security forces - mainly employees of the riot police and other similar structures. According to him, in some units about 70% of employees have already contacted BYPOL. All communication with them takes place in secure messengers. Igor Loban In the age of information technology, we have ways of conspiracy, and we do not worry that our sources can be disclosed. In order for the leak, the authorities will have to agree with [the creator of the Telegram messenger] Pavel Durov, which, in our opinion, is simply unrealistic. Andrei Ostapovich in a conversation with Medusa also admitted that the Belarusian security forces are now actively trying to figure out their colleagues cooperating with his project - but so far there have been no such cases. Another member of BYPOL - former senior operative of the Main Department of Internal Affairs of the Minsk City Executive Committee Matvey Kupreychik - stressed that high-ranking security forces are not afraid to contact the project. Thanks to this, on December 28, the project managed to publish an audio recording of the alleged conversation of former Interior Minister Karaev about the political component of the case of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's husband Sergei. Among other things, the voice on the recording, allegedly belonging to Karaev, calls Tikhanov \"destroyor of the state\" and \"creature\".","title":"WHY THIS UNIVERSITY?"},{"location":"notes/BYPOL/#who-is-sergei-tichanovsky","text":"Alexander Lukashenko's election competitor is the wife of the [arrested](./arrested.md) blogger.

Despite the fact that the detention took place in the apartment, the protocol stated that Vladimir was walking along Pobediteley Avenue in Minsk and shouted \"anti-state slogans,\" he added.

In 2012, Khilko resigned from SK with the rank of captain, moved to the United States and began working in the field of IT. And when the mass protests began, she wanted to help the demonstrators and entered the NAU. She had the idea of reform in the autumn of 2020. According to her, by that time it was already clear that without such a reform, the Ministry of Internal Affairs simply could not exist, as it had turned into a system of political investigation and \"suppression of will\" of Belarusians. Khilko explained to Medusa that about 20 people are involved in the work on the reform (not counting third-party consultants) and its principles have already been formulated. Most importantly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs should return to the protection of the rights of ordinary citizens and establish communication with people. According to NAU, this can be facilitated, among other things, by the renaming of the police into the police. Another important point is the decentralization of the department, after which the police of any city will not be directly controlled only by the Minister of the Interior. Svetlana Khilko Now law enforcement officers lack a sense of responsibility. They say that they received an order from above, but few people understand that everyone is responsible for making decisions.

But how did it happen - and what to do about it? All important questions are answered by sociologist Kirill Titayev While the oppositionists are preparing to create a new Ministry of Internal Affairs, the old one, according to their data, has already faced a large-scale staff leak. On January 6, BYPOL published an internal analytical review of the staffing of the Ministry of Internal Affairs system for the first nine months of 2020. The author of the secret document is the head of the department for coordination and interaction of personnel units and ideological work of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Colonel Alexander Mazur. Within the first nine months of 2020, 2,091 employees resigned from the department, while in the third quarter, when protests began in the country, there were more than half of the dismissals - 1,074 people. According to BYPOL, by the beginning of 2021, there were even more resigned - many security forces had contracts ended on December 31, a significant part of them refused to renew the contract with the state (the exact number of employees who refused to extend contracts in BYPOL plans to be named later). However, according to the project, now the Belarusian authorities are actively preparing for the onset of spring and the continuation of mass protests: they are purchasing weapons, bulletproof vests and special means. Matvey Kupreychik in a conversation with Medusa noted that this may not help in conditions of shortages. \"As soon as it gets warmer, people will start going out en masse again. And now all factors say that it will be much more difficult to suppress a new wave of protest to the authorities and the power bloc than in August,\" Kupreychik is sure.

On July 30, the head of the KGB Ivan Tertel said that the agency records \"a sharp increase in the work of foreign special services and related destructive formations.\" On August 17, Lukashenko advised the authorities to switch to paper media if they cannot protect information electronically: \"Write by hand and put it in your box.\" And on August 18, a Belarusian court recognized two telegram channels \"Cyberpartisan\" as \"extremist.\"","title":"Shortly after the beginning of drains from the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the telegram channels \"Cyberpartisan\" were recognized as \"extremist\""},{"location":"notes/BYPOL/#leaks-from-the-bases-of-the-ministry-of-internal-affairs-clearly-harm-belarusian-security-forces-but-they-can-also-harm-ordinary-belarusians","text":"\"If the attack is confirmed, it is the largest and most successful hacking of [state systems] since 2015, when Chinese hackers hacked into the servers of the Personnel Service Department in the United States,\" Andrei Baranovich, a spokesman for the hacker group \"Ukrainian Cyber Alliance\", told \"Present Time\". \"They are so sophisticated and attack on several levels, I've only seen this in movies before,\" Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University of Canada and cyberactivism expert, told Bloomberg. The data posted by Cyberpartisans show that \"Belarusian officials knew that they were attacking innocent people and exceeding force for no reason,\" said digital security specialist from Belarus Nikolai Kvantaliani in a conversation with Bloomberg. Other experts believe that the information received by Belarusian hackers can play a role in case of trials against Lukashenko and his associates in international courts, distrust the ranks of Belarusian security forces and officials, and, on the contrary, encourage protesters. Belarusian military expert Yegor Lebedok in a conversation with Euroradio called the incident a \"loud failure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\" and said that when they get abroad, the information received by \"Cyberpartisans\" may threaten, among other things, foreign intelligence officers of Belarus. At the same time, as Lebedok emphasized, the leak from the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is dangerous not only for security forces, but also for ordinary citizens - because their data can also be disclosed.

Her prominent ultra-nationalist father, Alexander Dugin, said to be close to Mr Putin, may have been the intended target of the attack. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement in the explosion. FSB told Russian media that a Ukrainian woman had moved to Russia in July alongside her young daughter - but that she was in fact a Ukrainian special services contractor. The woman, it said, rented an apartment in the same building as Ms Dugina for a month, preparing for the attack. In that time, she allegedly followed the journalist through Moscow in a Mini Cooper - for which she used three different licence plates. The suspect then escaped to Estonia after the explosion, the FSB said. Ms Dugina and her father were attending a festival near Moscow on Saturday evening where Mr Dugin, a philosopher, gave a lecture. They had reportedly intended to leave in the same car, but changed their plans at the last minute. Investigators said explosives had been planted underneath the Toyota Land Cruiser Ms Dugina was driving. Video from the scene posted online appeared to show a shaken Mr Dugin watching emergency services attend the burning vehicle. A family friend, Konstantin Malofeev, published a statement on behalf of Mr Dugin which branded his daughter's killing \"a terrorist act by the Ukrainian Nazi regime\". One studio guest suggested the response would be \"holy fury\" and the programme showed a photograph of mortar shells, apparently belonging to pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, one of which had \"This is for Darya!\" scrawled on the side. Analyst Yekaterina Shulman says the outpouring of anger amongst pro-Kremlin commentators in response to the car bomb attack appears suspicious: \"The reaction\u2026was immediate. It looks as if they were waiting for something like this to happen.\" Whoever was responsible, says Ms Shulman, the killing \"could possibly be used to ramp up some public outrage within the country to justify even more active repressive actions on the part of the state\". https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62634359","title":"Darya Dugin"},{"location":"notes/Dmitrievsky%20Chemical%20Plant/","text":"Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant \u00b6 2022-04-21 fire Chemical https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-fires-mystery-ukraine-conflict/31884503.html fire engulfs a building of the Dmitrievsky Chemical Plant near Ivanovo , around 240 kilometers northeast of Moscow , on April 21.

According to the Ukrainian government, some 1.6 million Ukrainians have been forcibly relocated to Russia , with about 250,000 of these being children. The Russian government denies it is forcibly removing Ukrainians to Russia and calls the deportations \"evacuation\". Overview Ukrainians in Russian-occupied zones are often left unable to flee into Ukrainian-held territory, having to either stay in areas experiencing unliveable conditions or flee to other areas under Russian control or into Russia itself. To enter Russia, many Ukrainians are forced to undergo \" filtration \", a process during which they are interrogated, and their biometric data is taken. While awaiting \" filtration \", Ukrainians are settled in so-called \" filtration camps \", set up ad hoc in various public buildings where the \" filtration \" takes place. After passing \" filtration \", Ukrainians are reportedly often forcibly transferred to the Russian Far East. Location of the filtration camps As of June 2022, most filtration camps were attested to be located in towns and villages across the puppet quasi-state Donetsk People's Republic, with the camps occupying what had been public buildings like schools, cultural centres, sports halls. In a July 2022 statement to the OSCE, a U.S. diplomat stated that the U.S. had identified at least 18 filtration camp sites set up by Russia both in Ukrainian and Russian territory, with preparations of filtration camps having been undertaken even before the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The filtration camps had been set up in Ukrainian territory that had recently come under Russian occupation by Russian officials working alongside proxy groups, the U.S. diplomat said. The U.S. diplomat said the filtration camps were set up in what had been schools, sport centres, and cultural institutions. An article published by the Polish Spokesman for the Minister Coordinator of Special Services found and published the location of six such camps \u201cwhere there are Russian torture chambers used against Ukrainians.\u201d Intake and detention Fleeing Ukrainians have been transferred into filtration camps unknowingly, being falsely told that they are being taken to Ukrainian-held territory. After arriving in filtration camps , detainees are told they are not allowed to leave the town in which the filtration camp is located as they await \" filtration \". Detention in filtration camps have been reported to last anywhere from a couple of days to many weeks. Living conditions Living conditions in the camps are often squalid. The camps are poorly organised. Those detained in the camps have said they had to sleep on the floors or on cardboard, and that meal rations were scant or altogether absent. \" Filtration \" and interrogation During filtration , detainees are photographed, fingerprinted, interrogated, and the contents of their phones are examined. Detainees are questioned about whether they know anyone serving in the Ukrainian army. Men are strip-searched to be examined for Ukrainian nationalist tattoos. Detainees have reported being asked about their political views and any ties to the Azov Regiment. \" Filtration \" usually ends in one of two ways: either the detainee is given a document certifying that they have passed filtration , or they are detained for further interrogation. Even after passing \" filtration \", some men are interrogated again during their passage from the filtration camp across areas under Russian control. Violence, torture, and killings Beatings, torture with electricity, and killings have been reported by people interrogated in the filtration camps . In May 2022, videos with Ukrainian civilians apologizing to Russian soldiers, with some of them saying that they had undergone a \"denazification course\", have appeared on social media. In an interview to Current Time TV , human rights activist Pavel Lisyansky said that the \"courses\" are often accompanied by physical violence, moral pressure and humiliation, and compared them to the \"re-education\" of Uyghurs by the Chinese government. Lisyansky also said that he knows three or four cases of Ukrainian civilians getting killed and their documents destroyed after they had a conflict with their \"curator\". Release and forced deportations People that have passed through the filtration camps have said that they had been sent to various cities across Russia after their release from the filtration camps , with many having been sent to the Russian Far East. Ukrainian intelligence has said that Ukrainian citizens released from filtration camps are offered employment in economically depressed regions of Russia by Russian employment centres. Mikhail Mizintsev, chief of Russia's National Defense Management Center, said on 8 May 2022 that 1,185,791 people have been moved to Russia. Escape from filtration and forced deportation Ukrainians that have fled into Georgia have avoided forced deportations into Russian cities that are reportedly common after passing \" filtration \". Some Ukrainians that were detained in filtration camps have said that informing filtration camp officials that they have concrete plans go live to a specific Russian city enabled them to be released and told to find their own way there, thus enabling them to escape into Georgia and avoid forced transfers. Some people reported that they needed to slip out of filtration camps in Novoazovsk or post-filtering from Taganrog or Rostov-on-Don to escape through neighboring countries like Georgia, rather than be forcibly sent to distant parts of Russia. History On 15 March 2022, The Guardian reported that witnesses have said that Russian troops have ordered women and children out of a bomb shelter in Mariupol. One witness said they were forcibly bussed with two or three hundred others to Novoazovsk, where they had to wait for hours inside the buses until they were ordered to go through a group of tents to what was called a filtration camp . Satellite imagery showed a group of tents in Bezimenne, near Novoazovsk. Representatives of Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic said they had set up a \" tent city of 30 tents\" with a capacity for 450 people. Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta said 5,000 Ukrainians had been processed in the Bezimenne camp and that they had run checks to prevent \"Ukrainian nationalists from infiltrating Russia disguised as refugees so they could avoid punishment.\" One witness said she was extensively questioned by men who said they were from the FSB. She was questioned about her background and described the questioning as \"very degrading\". The group was then taken to Rostov. Reactions Ukraine: Ukrainian officials have compared the filtration camps to filtration camps in Chechnya Russia: The Russian Embassy in the United States has said the filtration camps are \"checkpoints for civilians leaving the zone of active hostilities\". United States United States ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said \"I do not need to spell out what these so-called ' filtration camps ' are reminiscent of. It's chilling and we cannot look away\". She cited reports that FSB agents confiscated passports, IDs and mobile phones, as well as reports of Ukrainian families being separated. The US envoy to the OSCE, Michail Carpenter, told the organization's permanent council that according to credible reporting, Ukrainian civilians in the filtration camps were interrogated and those suspected of ties to independent media or the military were beaten or tortured before being transferred to the Donetsk region, \"where they are reportedly disappeared - \"Enforced disappearance\" or murdered. Non-governmental organisations: Tanya Lokshina, director of Human Rights Watch for Europe and Asia, said: \"Under international human rights law, forced displacement or transfer doesn't necessarily mean people were forced into a vehicle at gunpoint, but rather that they found themselves in a situation that left them no choice.\" She pointed out that the Geneva Convention prohibits \"individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory, are prohibited, regardless of their motive\". === The International Federation for Human Rights and its affiliate in Ukraine, the Center for Civil Liberties (CSF), reported evidence of the forcible transfer of civilians by the Russian military from the besieged Mariupo to Russia, and the Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast, and Crimea using the practice of filtration camps . According to the CSF, families were separated, and documents and phones were confiscated. According to the CSF, Russian forces also prevented civilians from passing through humanitarian corridors to the non-occupied parts of Ukraine, opening fire on them. According to Ukrainian officials, the same practice was used by Russian troops in Sumy, Kharkiv and Kyiv.","title":"Filtration Camp System"},{"location":"notes/Forcible%20transfer%20of%20Ukrainian%20population%20to%20Russia%20constitutes%20a%20war%20crime/","text":"https://www.fidh.org/en International Federation for Human Rights Forcible transfer of Ukrainian population to Russia constitutes a war crime \u00b6 31/03/2022 Leon Klein / Anadolu Agency via AFP Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine has triggered a blood-curdling humanitarian and human rights [[crisis|crisis]] that continues to grow. Evidence of the forced displacement of civilians from besieged Mariupol to Russia adds to the already documented array of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by Putin\u2019s regime since 2014. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the Centre for Civil Liberties (CCL), its member organisation in Ukraine, call on international organisations to ensure international on-the-spot monitoring of the situation in Ukraine , which is vital to establish humanitarian passages and protect those forcibly transferred to Russia. About 15,000 residents of Mariupol have been deported to Russia, the CCL, FIDH\u2019s member organization on the ground, reported on March 28. The Russian military forces civilians onto buses, without qualms separating families, taking away their Ukrainian passports and phones. They send them to Crimea and the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions, or else so-called filtration camps , from where they are \"redistributed\" to various distant cities in Russia. While some 100,000 civilians remain trapped in the city without access to water or energy, Russian forces have stepped up their shelling of Mariupol and are not allowing civilians to pass through humanitarian corridors into the unoccupied parts of Ukraine. According to CCL, Russian forces have opened fire on civilians fleeing war zones to safer areas controlled by the Ukrainian government. The residents of Mariupol are not the only ones being forcibly transferred. According to Ukrainian officials, Russia has begun transfers from the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Kharkiv to a Russian border city, Belgorod. Several hundred residents of Kiyv and its surroundings ended up in Belarus as their passage to the west to Chernihiv region was blocked by the Russian military. From the beginning of February 2022, about 100,000 Ukrainians, residents of the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, were transferred to Russian territory. FIDH and CCL deplore the forced transfer of the Ukrainian population by Russia, while it continues to sabotage the evacuation of civilians to the non-occupied parts of Ukraine. The forcible transfer of civilian populations to other areas against their will may constitute a war crime under international humanitarian law and customary international law because it is carried out without a visible humanitarian purpose. If these violations prove being committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, forcible transfer may also constitute crime against humanity punishable under the Statute of the International Criminal Court. FIDH and its member organisations have repeatedly condemned Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and continues to denounce the numerous violations of humanitarian law and human rights committed by the Russian army in Ukraine. FIDH and its member organisation in Ukraine call on the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the Permanent Council of the OSCE in Vienna, the European Commissioner for Human Rights, monitoring mechanisms of the European Council, the relevant regional initiatives and mechanisms of the United Nations (UN), including the UN Human Rights Council, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the International Committee of the Red Cross to use all available mechanisms and resources to ensure international on-the-spot monitoring of the situation in Ukraine , which is vital to enforce Russia\u2019s compliance with the norms of international humanitarian law, including the establishment of humanitarian passages and the protection of forcibly transferred persons in Russia.

Glad you could make it. On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine giving any number of crazy excuses for their invasion, brutality, rape, looting, cultural genocide and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and children. Due to this, the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Community has banded together, combining specialties and tools in support of Ukraine. Sometimes, it takes a village. We do not focus on military losses or troop movements. The information we seek with this project is different. For Russia losses, check out Ragnar's awesome dashboard where you can visualize multiple views for the same data in useful and insightful ways. You can find it here https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/dfbcec47-7b01-400e-ab21-de8eb98c8f3a?s=nwLjV75LVrw A few points about this data. This is a compilation of events that indicate citizens within Russia and Belarus may be taking action as anti-war direct action and sabotage. The data of those kinds of events currently spans February 2022 to July 2022, but will be expanded with time. The goals of these attacks are to draw attention to the war, to make political and anti-war statements, to decrease the moral of the Russian people and soldiers, and to slow, delay, hinder or otherwise disable infrastructure, strategic targets, supplies, weapons and logistics required by Russia to fight in Ukraine, including using Belarus as a staging ground. It is often impossible to verify whether or not an event is an act of sabotage or usual fall out from shoddy Russian building standards and materials. We make best-guess efforts, based on timing, location and targets (whether they might be strategic or political or protest related), claims of individuals or groups as to their direct action activities and legal case filings against people in Russia for \"terrorism\" or \"hooliganism\". As such, we include all reports if there is the potential of sabotage to leave room for more information to become available. It is up to you to include or exclude the events of your choice, based on your own criteria In all cases, we have taken steps to protect the identities of vulnerable individuals or groups. In cases where names and details linked to them have been made officially public in Russia or Belarus, we have retained that information (such as arrest or court records). In cases of self-attribution, we have included this at our discretion as well. This data was compiled from reporting in global media, local and regional reporting, curated Telegram channels, activist websites, alert and monitoring programs and apps, and from curated accounts on Twitter such as @AmplifyUkraine, @VelvetBlade, @DemeryUK, @TWMCLtd, @StillDelvingH, @HarladF, @Russiasonfire, @Bellingcat This data was augmented by several sources including lists of military contracting companies and factories within Russia, Wikipedia, WordNik, WordNet, CartoDB and articles. This vault also contains some data on filtration camps and locations where Ukrainians citizens may be sent to within Russia, including children. This vault will be updated as more data becomes available and more \"care and feeding\" goes into drawing out meaning and connections How to Use this Vault This vault was created with Obsidian, a free and expandable open source markdown project. It has been Published through Digital Garden for Obsidian, which has allowed us to post these bits of data for you to enjoy without the hassles of coding or self hosting. As such, expect things to improve over time.

The first attack occurred on February 28, 2022 in the city of Lukhovitsy in the Moscow region. An unidentified person broke two windows of the recruitment office and threw Molotov cocktails into the office. In addition, the gates of the building were painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. No one was injured in the fire , but property damage was caused. The suspect was later arrested and criminal proceedings were initiated on charges of \u201cvandalism\u201d. It turned out that it was Kirill, a 21-year-old resident. On March 13, around 6 a.m., the suspected arsonist fled the police station and was put on the wanted list. He was arrested again in the evening on the same day. Lukhovitsy , Moscow Region The first arson of the military commissariat, which became known to the media, was discovered, apparently, at the end of February\u2013then the commissariat in Lukhovitsy in the Moscow region caught fire . how wrote \u201cMoskovsky Komsomolets\u201d, 21-year-old local resident: on February 28, he broke a window and threw a drink with \u201cMolotov cocktails\u201d into it. \u201cIn addition, the gates of the military commissariat were painted in the color of the Ukrainian flag, and a provocative note about the special operation of the Russian Armed Forces was left,\u201d the newspaper said. But the Kolomna media ( Lukhovitsy are located near this city) wrote about arson only on March 9th. And the day before, in the telegram channel \u201cVataHunters\u201d appeared video, which shows how someone in the dark throws water into a one-story building, after which a fire starts. The Moscow Region police have not officially commented on the arson . Details of the arrest of the \u201cMK\u201d arsonist\u2013according to the newspaper, the arrest of the 21-year-old husband was possible only on March 8. And on March 13 he escaped from the police station, asking for time off to go to the toilet. In the evening of the same day, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs officially announced that the police from Lukhovitsy \u201clocated the location of the criminal\u201d born in 2001, who died under the article \u201cVandalism\u201d (214 of the Criminal Code). The police said that he \u201carbitrarily left the building of the police department,\u201d but was re- detained . There is nothing unusual about the arson of the military registration and enlistment office. https://europe-cities.com/2022/05/04/in-russia-after-the-invasion-of-ukraine-they-began-to-set-fire-to-military-registration-and-enlistment-offices/ FROM PARTISAN: The other day I set fire to the military registration and enlistment office in Lukhovitsy , Moscow region and filmed it on GoPro. I painted the gates in the colors of the Ukrainian flag and wrote: \u201cI will not go kill my brothers!\u201d, then climbed over the fence, poured gasoline on the front, broke the windows and sent Molotov cocktails into them. The aim was to destroy the archive with the personal files of the conscripts, which is located in this unit. This should prevent mobilization in the district. I hope that I won\u2019t see mclassmates in captivity or in the lists of the dead. I think it should be spread. Ukrainians will know that people in Russia are fighting for them, not everyone is afraid and there are people who care. Our protesters should be inspired to act more radically. And this should break the spirit of the Russian army and government even more. Let these faggots know that their own people hate them and will extinguish them. The ground will soon burn beneath their feet, hell awaits them at home as well. https://darknights.noblogs.org/post/2022/03/26/russia-numerous-attacks-against-military-recruitment-centers/ UPDATE: Meanwhile, details of the escape of the arsonist from the Lukhovitsy recruitment office have emerged. MK journalists report that Kirill, a 21-year-old local resident, after setting fire to the recruitment office on the night of February 28, dumped his phone and did not contact his family. He was arrested on the border between Belarus and Lithuania on March 8. The arsonist was immediately extradited and taken to the police station in Lukhovitsy . Kirill told the police that he intended to go to the Ukraine territory, where the Russian Federation is carrying out a special operation . Criminal proceedings were initiated against him under the Criminal act, paragraph \u201cVandalism\u201d. On March 13, in the early morning hours, he asked to go to the toilet. The man was handcuffed and taken to the toilet at the criminal investigation department. From there, Kirill took advantage of the inattention of the guards, jumped out the window and ran away. He managed to climb over a three-meter high chain-link fence and run in the direction of the M5 highway . The fugitive\u2019s tracks have now been found in the forest in the direction of Kolomna. https://enoughisenough14.org/2022/03/14/russia-new-guerrilla-attacks-on-military-recruiting-agencies/ + 123","title":"[[OSINT Project/Maps/Lukhovitsy, Lukhovitsky District, Moscow Oblast, Central Federal District, Russia|Lukhovitsy]]-[[OSINT Project/Maps/Moscow, Central Federal District, Russia|Moscow]] Recruitment Office FIRST"},{"location":"notes/Lukhovitsy-Moscow%20Recruitment%20Office%20FIRST/#lukhovitsy-moscow-recruitment-office-first","text":"2022-02-28 Molotov Recruitment https://enoughisenough14.org/2022/06/26/shortly-after-the-longest-night-of-the-year-two-recruiting-offices-burned-at-once-chronicle-of-arson-attacks-until-june-25-2022-russia/ 1st recruitment office hit with Molotov cocktails in Lukhovitsy near Moscow . The first attack occurred on February 28, 2022 in the city of Lukhovitsy in the Moscow region. An unidentified person broke two windows of the recruitment office and threw Molotov cocktails into the office. In addition, the gates of the building were painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. No one was injured in the fire , but property damage was caused. The suspect was later arrested and criminal proceedings were initiated on charges of \u201cvandalism\u201d. It turned out that it was Kirill, a 21-year-old resident. On March 13, around 6 a.m., the suspected arsonist fled the police station and was put on the wanted list. He was arrested again in the evening on the same day. Lukhovitsy , Moscow Region The first arson of the military commissariat, which became known to the media, was discovered, apparently, at the end of February\u2013then the commissariat in Lukhovitsy in the Moscow region caught fire . how wrote \u201cMoskovsky Komsomolets\u201d, 21-year-old local resident: on February 28, he broke a window and threw a drink with \u201cMolotov cocktails\u201d into it. \u201cIn addition, the gates of the military commissariat were painted in the color of the Ukrainian flag, and a provocative note about the special operation of the Russian Armed Forces was left,\u201d the newspaper said. But the Kolomna media ( Lukhovitsy are located near this city) wrote about arson only on March 9th. And the day before, in the telegram channel \u201cVataHunters\u201d appeared video, which shows how someone in the dark throws water into a one-story building, after which a fire starts. The Moscow Region police have not officially commented on the arson . Details of the arrest of the \u201cMK\u201d arsonist\u2013according to the newspaper, the arrest of the 21-year-old husband was possible only on March 8. And on March 13 he escaped from the police station, asking for time off to go to the toilet. In the evening of the same day, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs officially announced that the police from Lukhovitsy \u201clocated the location of the criminal\u201d born in 2001, who died under the article \u201cVandalism\u201d (214 of the Criminal Code). The police said that he \u201carbitrarily left the building of the police department,\u201d but was re- detained . There is nothing unusual about the arson of the military registration and enlistment office. https://europe-cities.com/2022/05/04/in-russia-after-the-invasion-of-ukraine-they-began-to-set-fire-to-military-registration-and-enlistment-offices/ FROM PARTISAN: The other day I set fire to the military registration and enlistment office in Lukhovitsy , Moscow region and filmed it on GoPro. I painted the gates in the colors of the Ukrainian flag and wrote: \u201cI will not go kill my brothers!\u201d, then climbed over the fence, poured gasoline on the front, broke the windows and sent Molotov cocktails into them. The aim was to destroy the archive with the personal files of the conscripts, which is located in this unit. This should prevent mobilization in the district. I hope that I won\u2019t see mclassmates in captivity or in the lists of the dead. I think it should be spread. Ukrainians will know that people in Russia are fighting for them, not everyone is afraid and there are people who care. Our protesters should be inspired to act more radically. And this should break the spirit of the Russian army and government even more. Let these faggots know that their own people hate them and will extinguish them. The ground will soon burn beneath their feet, hell awaits them at home as well. https://darknights.noblogs.org/post/2022/03/26/russia-numerous-attacks-against-military-recruitment-centers/ UPDATE: Meanwhile, details of the escape of the arsonist from the Lukhovitsy recruitment office have emerged.

This filtration system is the physical infrastructure and process used to register, interrogate, and detain Ukrainian civilians, prisoners of war, and others in areas Russia and its proxies occupy. There is evidence that the system was created weeks before the invasion began and likely grew following Russia\u2019s capture of Mariupol in April 2022 to accommodate filtration of all citizens. Occupying powers in international conflicts have the right to register persons within their area of control; the force in control may even detain civilians in certain limited circumstances. However, Russia\u2019s apparent filtration system for persons within Donetsk oblast, which includes use of extrajudicial and incommunicado detention , violates multiple elements of international humanitarian law and raises multiple potentially grave human rights issues. Combining open-source information with very high-resolution satellite imagery, Yale HRL is able to present the most comprehensive public assessment to date of this large-scale apparatus of screening and extrajudicial detention . Explore Report Explore Factsheet Overall Findings Yale HRL's report offers four key findings: Russia and Russia-aligned forces operate at least 21 facilities in and around Donetsk oblast that are part of the filtration system; There appear to be four types of facilities involved in filtration : (1) registration, (2) holding, (3) secondary interrogation, and (4) detention ; Disturbed earth consistent with potential graves is present at Volnovakha Correctional Colony \u2116 120 near Olenivka, Volnovakha raion during two time periods. The same correctional colony was the location of the 29 July 2022 explosion that allegedly killed 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs); The appearance of disturbed earth sites in satellite imagery pre-dates the explosion. One area of disturbed earth was observed in imagery from 11 April 2022. This apparent disturbed earth is contemporaneous with an open source account of alleged gravedigging. Disturbed earth then appeared in a second location by 27 July 2022. https://hub.conflictobservatory.org/portal/apps/sites/#/home/pages/filtration-1","title":"Mapping the Filtration System in Donetsk Oblast"},{"location":"notes/Mayak%20Radio%20Transmitter%20Transnistria/","text":"Mayak Radio Transmitter Transnistria \u00b6 2022-04-25 Explosion Infrastructure https://liveuamap.com/en/2022/25-april-explosions-reported-in-tiraspol-transnistria-near 2 radio transmitters near Mayak Mayak Transnistria It's important to be careful with Transnistria.

He was abducted on 11 March from the Melitopol Crisis Centre by Russian soldiers who took him away with a bag over his head. Fedorov had refused to collaborate with the Russians who have seized the city and there are serious grounds for concern about his safety.

Fedorov (or a man with a bag over his head) is being forced out of the Melitopol Crisis Centre by a large number of armed men.

There have been protests every day since the Russian seizure of the city. Fedorov\u2019s abduction came a day after Russian soldiers burst into the Melitopol home of Leila Ibragimova , the Deputy Head of the Zaporizhya Regional Council, Director of the Melitopol City Museum and a member of the Crimean Tatar community. The Russian intruders carried out a \u2018search\u2019, seized her mobile phone and took her away, reportedly with a bag over her head. The armed men demanded that she give them names of local activists and also interrogated her about a local Crimean Tatar organization. She refused to provide the names demanded and was later released , but that abduction and now that of Fedorov and, seemingly, of Olha Haisumova, are chillingly reminiscent of the lawlessness, the abductions and enforced disappearances, especially of Crimean Tatars, that Russia brought to Crimea with its invasion in 2014.

On 4 March, the Melitopol City Council reported that Russian military had seized the television tower in Melitopol. The aim here, and in other seized cities , is to replace Ukrainian media with Russian propaganda channels. They are, however, meeting with widespread opposition. In Melitopol, for example, local residents came out onto the street with Ukrainian flags and held a procession in support of Ukraine.

The rail junction was dismantled and the rail tracks were partially disconnected. It must be emphasized that we are not sure that this disconnection was sufficient to free the train from the tracks. But it was a test sabotage, if you will, where we tested the feasibility with the help of tools. We also wanted the sabotage to be as inconspicuous as possible so that the train would not have time to come to a stop. Moreover, it is not sure that a derailment in such a deserted area will reach the media, and we have no possibility to observe it with our own eyes. Therefore, it was decided to publish the result of the attack \u201cas it was\u201d to share the experience with other guerrillas.

This section of the road leads to 14258 military unit. It's a secret training and tactical center of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for Russian nuclear security: Some important aspects of this action are: 1) A track was chosen that leads to a military unit where no civilian trains operate in order to avoid innocent victims. We recommend using wikimapia.org for the search. There, military installations are marked that are not visible on conventional maps. You can also use satellite maps to judge whether a facility is \u201cin operation.\u201d For example, on the base to which the attacked sidetrack leads, you can see a collection of military equipment in open areas. 2) This immediately led to restrictions in the possible actions: On these lines, the wagons are pulled by diesel locomotives, so there are no signal cabinets and no power lines. The main point of attack is therefore the tracks themselves 3) We dismantled the rail connection part and unscrewed the screw nuts holding the rail to the railway sleepers. Normal construction tools, adjustable wrenches with a length of > 0.5 m, proved to be sufficient for this. An adjustable wrench is also required because the rail is fastened with 2 types of screw nuts. We recommend the use of a lubricant to make it easier to unscrew the nuts, as many of them are rusty and hardened. 4) Then the track can be lifted with levers and moved to the side. The more nuts that are used to fasten the rail to the sleepers are unscrewed, the easier it is to move it. The method has proven to be quite feasible and safe, although it could cause serious damage to the armed forces of the Russian Federation. We recommend it to all to use it.

Not everyone is tough enough to go with Molotov to the enlistment office or burn a vehicle to the beasts guarding the regime. But everyone can take a photo and anonymously send along with the coordinates to the right people. Or collect information about beasts, print out leaflets, stick stickers, draw graffiti, supporting resistance. Sabotage at work in the relevant structures is no less important. It is not necessary to refuse military service if you can learn a lot of valuable information through this. It is not necessary to resign from law enforcement bodies if you can sabotage new cases to capture activists . Or leave the railway, seeing trains of equipment going to kill people in a neighboring country. Everyone must find their place in the Russia of the future, become this future today, and not leave Russian hopelessness as a legacy to children military recruitment centers burn every week, trains derail from the Kuban to the Far East, cables from zombieboxes are cut at the entrances.

The rail junction was dismantled and the rail tracks were partially disconnected. It must be emphasized that we are not sure that this disconnection was sufficient to free the train from the tracks. But it was a test sabotage, if you will, where we tested the feasibility with the help of tools. We also wanted the sabotage to be as inconspicuous as possible so that the train would not have time to come to a stop. Moreover, it is not sure that a derailment in such a deserted area will reach the media, and we have no possibility to observe it with our own eyes. Therefore, it was decided to publish the result of the attack \u201cas it was\u201d to share the experience with other guerrillas. Sergiyevo-Posadsky District Moscow Oblast, Russia 56 16\u201944\u2033N 38 12\u201940.5\u2033E, 56.278889, 38.211111 Date discrepancy - 23 or 26 May, 2022. Used earliest date. Earliest date confirmed. This section of the road leads to 14258 military unit. It's a secret training and tactical center of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for Russian nuclear security: Some important aspects of this action are: 1) A track was chosen that leads to a military unit where no civilian trains operate in order to avoid innocent victims. We recommend using wikimapia.org for the search. There, military installations are marked that are not visible on conventional maps. You can also use satellite maps to judge whether a facility is \u201cin operation.\u201d For example, on the base to which the attacked sidetrack leads, you can see a collection of military equipment in open areas. 2) This immediately led to restrictions in the possible actions: On these lines, the wagons are pulled by diesel locomotives, so there are no signal cabinets and no power lines. The main point of attack is therefore the tracks themselves 3) We dismantled the rail connection part and unscrewed the screw nuts holding the rail to the railway sleepers. Normal construction tools, adjustable wrenches with a length of > 0.5 m, proved to be sufficient for this. An adjustable wrench is also required because the rail is fastened with 2 types of screw nuts. We recommend the use of a lubricant to make it easier to unscrew the nuts, as many of them are rusty and hardened. 4) Then the track can be lifted with levers and moved to the side. The more nuts that are used to fasten the rail to the sleepers are unscrewed, the easier it is to move it. The method has proven to be quite feasible and safe, although it could cause serious damage to the armed forces of the Russian Federation. We recommend it to all to use it.

Not everyone is tough enough to go with Molotov to the enlistment office or burn a vehicle to the beasts guarding the regime. But everyone can take a photo and anonymously send along with the coordinates to the right people. Or collect information about beasts, print out leaflets, stick stickers, draw graffiti, supporting resistance. Sabotage at work in the relevant structures is no less important. It is not necessary to refuse military service if you can learn a lot of valuable information through this. It is not necessary to resign from law enforcement bodies if you can sabotage new cases to capture activists . Or leave the railway, seeing trains of equipment going to kill people in a neighboring country. Everyone must find their place in the Russia of the future, become this future today, and not leave Russian hopelessness as a legacy to children military recruitment centers burn every week, trains derail from the Kuban to the Far East, cables from zombieboxes are cut at the entrances. The geography of resistance will only expand, because everyone has just begun to taste the delights of life in a new reality: total lack of freedom, a swooping economy, an Iron Curtain.

The man has been searched, during it two canisters of gasoline, wire, potassium permanganate, funnels, five bank cards and three iPhones were seized. Farber is a painter and former director of a rural house of culture in the Tver region. In 2013, he was convicted of abuse of office and taking a bribe.

The rail junction was dismantled and the rail tracks were partially disconnected. It must be emphasized that we are not sure that this disconnection was sufficient to free the train from the tracks. But it was a test sabotage, if you will, where we tested the feasibility with the help of tools. We also wanted the sabotage to be as inconspicuous as possible so that the train would not have time to come to a stop. Moreover, it is not sure that a derailment in such a deserted area will reach the media, and we have no possibility to observe it with our own eyes. Therefore, it was decided to publish the result of the attack \u201cas it was\u201d to share the experience with other guerrillas. Sergiyevo-Posadsky District Moscow Oblast, Russia 56 16\u201944\u2033N 38 12\u201940.5\u2033E, 56.278889, 38.211111 Date discrepancy - 23 or 26 May, 2022. Used earliest date. Earliest date confirmed. This section of the road leads to 14258 military unit. It's a secret training and tactical center of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for Russian nuclear security: Some important aspects of this action are: 1) A track was chosen that leads to a military unit where no civilian trains operate in order to avoid innocent victims. We recommend using wikimapia.org for the search. There, military installations are marked that are not visible on conventional maps. You can also use satellite maps to judge whether a facility is \u201cin operation.\u201d For example, on the base to which the attacked sidetrack leads, you can see a collection of military equipment in open areas. 2) This immediately led to restrictions in the possible actions: On these lines, the wagons are pulled by diesel locomotives, so there are no signal cabinets and no power lines. The main point of attack is therefore the tracks themselves 3) We dismantled the rail connection part and unscrewed the screw nuts holding the rail to the railway sleepers. Normal construction tools, adjustable wrenches with a length of > 0.5 m, proved to be sufficient for this. An adjustable wrench is also required because the rail is fastened with 2 types of screw nuts. We recommend the use of a lubricant to make it easier to unscrew the nuts, as many of them are rusty and hardened. 4) Then the track can be lifted with levers and moved to the side. The more nuts that are used to fasten the rail to the sleepers are unscrewed, the easier it is to move it. The method has proven to be quite feasible and safe, although it could cause serious damage to the armed forces of the Russian Federation. We recommend it to all to use it.

The rail junction was dismantled and the rail tracks were partially disconnected. It must be emphasized that we are not sure that this disconnection was sufficient to free the train from the tracks. But it was a test sabotage, if you will, where we tested the feasibility with the help of tools. We also wanted the sabotage to be as inconspicuous as possible so that the train would not have time to come to a stop. Moreover, it is not sure that a derailment in such a deserted area will reach the media, and we have no possibility to observe it with our own eyes. Therefore, it was decided to publish the result of the attack \u201cas it was\u201d to share the experience with other guerrillas.

This section of the road leads to 14258 military unit. It's a secret training and tactical center of the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for Russian nuclear security: Some important aspects of this action are: 1) A track was chosen that leads to a military unit where no civilian trains operate in order to avoid innocent victims. We recommend using wikimapia.org for the search. There, military installations are marked that are not visible on conventional maps. You can also use satellite maps to judge whether a facility is \u201cin operation.\u201d For example, on the base to which the attacked sidetrack leads, you can see a collection of military equipment in open areas. 2) This immediately led to restrictions in the possible actions: On these lines, the wagons are pulled by diesel locomotives, so there are no signal cabinets and no power lines. The main point of attack is therefore the tracks themselves 3) We dismantled the rail connection part and unscrewed the screw nuts holding the rail to the railway sleepers. Normal construction tools, adjustable wrenches with a length of > 0.5 m, proved to be sufficient for this. An adjustable wrench is also required because the rail is fastened with 2 types of screw nuts. We recommend the use of a lubricant to make it easier to unscrew the nuts, as many of them are rusty and hardened. 4) Then the track can be lifted with levers and moved to the side. The more nuts that are used to fasten the rail to the sleepers are unscrewed, the easier it is to move it. The method has proven to be quite feasible and safe, although it could cause serious damage to the armed forces of the Russian Federation. We recommend it to all to use it.

If you want to skip the explainer and jump right to it you can start here: Index of Notes: https://osint-project.netlify.app/notes/_Index_of_Russia-Belarus Index of Maps: https://osint-project.netlify.app/notes/Maps/_Index_of_Maps On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine giving any number of crazy excuses for their invasion, brutality, rape, looting, cultural genocide and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and children. Due to this, the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Community has banded together, combining specialties and tools in support of Ukraine. Sometimes, it takes a village. We do not focus on military losses or troop movements. The information we seek with this project is different. For Russia losses, check out Ragnar's awesome dashboard where you can visualize multiple views for the same data in useful and insightful ways. A few points about this data. This is a compilation of events that indicate citizens within Russia and Belarus may be taking action as anti-war direct action and sabotage. The data of those kinds of events currently spans February 2022 to July 2022, but will be expanded with time. The goals of these attacks are to draw attention to the war, to make political and anti-war statements, to decrease the moral of the Russian people and soldiers, and to slow, delay, hinder or otherwise disable infrastructure, strategic targets, supplies, weapons and logistics required by Russia to fight in Ukraine, including using Belarus as a staging ground. It is often impossible to verify whether or not an event is an act of sabotage or usual fall out from shoddy Russian building standards and materials. We make best-guess efforts, based on timing, location and targets (whether they might be strategic or political or protest related), claims of individuals or groups as to their direct action activities and legal case filings against people in Russia for \"terrorism\" or \"hooliganism\". As such, we include all reports if there is the potential of sabotage to leave room for more information to become available. It is up to you to include or exclude the events of your choice, based on your own criteria In all cases, we have taken steps to protect the identities of vulnerable individuals or groups. In cases where names and details linked to them have been made officially public in Russia or Belarus, we have retained that information (such as arrest or court records). In cases of self-attribution, we have included this at our discretion as well. This data was compiled from reporting in global media, local and regional reporting, curated Telegram channels, activist websites, alert and monitoring programs and apps, and from curated accounts on Twitter such as @AmplifyUkraine, @VelvetBlade, @DemeryUK, @TWMCLtd, @StillDelvingH, @HarladF, @Russiasonfire, @Bellingcat This data was augmented by several sources including lists of military contracting companies and factories within Russia, Wikipedia, WordNik, WordNet, CartoDB and articles. This vault also contains some data on filtration camps and locations where Ukrainians citizens may be sent to within Russia, including children. This vault will be updated as more data becomes available and more \"care and feeding\" goes into drawing out meaning and connections How to Use this Vault This vault was created with Obsidian, a free and expandable open source markdown project. It has been Published through Digital Garden for Obsidian, which has allowed us to post these bits of data for you to enjoy without the hassles of coding or self hosting. As such, expect things to improve over time. Obsidian is a rich community of enthusiasts and this project has been enhanced on the shoulders of several plug-ins most notably: Adjacency Matrix Viewer Breadcrumbs Dataview Find unlinked files and unresolved links Digital Garden NLP Obsidian 42 - BRAT Journey Translator Linter Note Refactor Map View (set with CARTO DB) Omni Search Topic Linking Juggl Graph Analysis Wikipedia Obsidian 42 - WordNet WordNik Zootelkeeper Roadmap Obsidian is an excellent markdown tool and can do many things. This use is not really how it was intended to be used, but we wanted to stretch and create a use case for the OSINT potential within Obsidian. Getting some of these roadmap items to work with Obsidian might be a bit of a dance, but we are of the mind that one should always look at a problem and find potential solutions. This sparks the creativity of puzzle solvers. Currently most of this work is done by hand and so is in a constant state of \"in progress\". Automating some of this once there is a baseline is a goal.

PMCs refer to their personnel as \"security contractors\" or \" private military contractor s\". The services and expertise offered by PMCs are typically similar to those of governmental security, military , or police forces but most often on a smaller scale. PMCs often provide services to train or supplement official armed forces in service of governments, but they can also be employed by private companies to provide bodyguards for key staff or protection of company premises, especially in hostile territories. However, contractors that use armed force in a warzone may be considered unlawful combatants in reference to a concept that is outlined in the Geneva Conventions and explicitly stated by the 2006 American Military Commissions Act.The services of private contractors are used around the world. P. W. Singer, the author of Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry, stated, \"In geographic terms, it operates in over 50 countries. It\u2019s operated in every single continent but Antarctica.\" Singer noted that in the 1990s, there were 50 military personnel for every contractor and that the ratio is now 10 to 1. He also pointed out that the contractors have a number of duties, depending on who hires them. In developing countries that have natural resources, such as oil refineries in Iraq, they are hired to guard the area. They are hired also to guard companies that contract services and reconstruction efforts such as General Electric. Apart from securing companies, they secure officials and government affiliates. Private military companies carry out many missions and jobs.

While the Russians claim that they are \u2018evacuating\u2019 people, many are believed to have been taken against their will or through deceit, and often transported to the most inhospitable parts of the Russian Federation. In her press briefing , Denisova spoke of the methods of so-called \u2018 filtration \u2019 used by the Russian invading forces. As reported earlier, these include forcing people to take off their clothes to check tattoos for \u2018suspicious\u2019 pro-Ukrainian content and scrutinizing contacts and content of mobile telephones. All are automatically asked about their opinion of the so-called \u2018 special military operation \u2019, as Russia describes its total invasion of Ukraine. Those who \u2018fail\u2019 such filtration , being considered \u2018suspect\u2019 by the Russia \u2019s FSB [security service] for their pro-Ukrainian views, contacts, etc., are sent to Donetsk or Dokuchaevsk on the territory of the Russian proxy \u2018Donetsk people\u2019s republic\u2019 [DPR]. While Denisova says that no exact figures are known, she does speak of some 20 thousand people held in various camps . Since that press briefing, more details have emerged regarding where people from Mariupol viewed as ideologically \u2018unreliable\u2019 get sent. Petro Andriushchenko, Advisor to the Mayor of Mariupol, earlier provided details and video footage of two \u2018 filtration camps \u2019 in the villages of Bezimenne and Kozatske (both in \u2018DPR\u2019]. He explained that around two thousand men from the districts of Huhlino, Myrny and Volonterivka, had been held against their will in appalling conditions for over a month. On 11 May, Andriushchenko announced that they had received answers to many questions regarding the Mariupol residents who had \u2018not passed\u2019 the filtration procedure and had disappeared. Those considered \u2018unreliable\u2019, he said, are sent to former corrective prison colony No. 52 in Olenivka (within \u2018DPR\u2019] or, possibly, to the Izolyatsia secret prison in Donetsk. No. 52 is where they place the relatives of military servicemen; former members of the law enforcement bodies; civic activists ; journalists, as well as anybody deemed \u2018suspicious\u2019, for example, because of patriotic tattoos. The minimum term of incarceration is 36 days, with this the term allocated for so-called \u2018 filtration \u2019. The premises are overcrowded, with facilities designed for 850 people holding at least three thousand, with most of these from Mariupol and the surrounding area. Those held there are not provided with sufficient water or food, and they are only taken to the toilet once a day. All of this is while they are subjected to interrogation lasting many hours; torture ; threats of execution and attempts to force them to collaborate. Some are lucky and get released after 36 days, having been forced to sign whatever papers are thrust in front of them. Andriushchenko\u2019s sources cannot say what the papers are, but assume that these are about collaboration. He notes that there are a huge number of cases where people simply disappear after interrogation, with the gossip being that those ones have been sent to even worse prisons , including Izolyatsia. The latter is the most notorious of the secret prisons in occupied Donbas. Former inmates call this a concentration camp and have given harrowing accounts of the torture inflicted on both men and women. In fact, Andriushchenko is almost certainly right in saying that the so-called filtration camp at Olenivka can also be called a 21st century concentration camp . Denisova explained that it is usually the elderly, women and children who get through the initial \u2018 filtration \u2019 and get sent to different parts of the Russian Federation. Denisova added that she has evidence that this enforced deportation was planned by the Russian authorities in advance, with a directive having been sent to different federal districts. In fact, immediately prior to the total invasion, Russia and its Donbas proxies did announce total \u2018evacuation\u2019 to Russia of all women, children and the elderly from the so-called \u2018Donetsk and Luhansk people\u2019s republics\u2019. Although there were reported to be very few takers at first, that may have changed after [[[[Russia|[[Russia|Russia]]|[[Russi|Russi]]a|Russian]] bombs became falling throughout Ukraine. In areas that the Russians invaded in 2022, the situation is quite different. There is considerable evidence that people were rounded up (as Denisova says, even from basements where they were hiding from the bombs) and taken away by buses . Even if some agreed to go, this would likely have been seen as the only way of surviving given Russia \u2019s siege of Mariupol and refusal to provide corridors for those wishing to evacuate to government-controlled parts of Ukraine. Denisova also pointed out that the Russians are also taking food away, including to occupied Crimea, with this clearly part of the same deliberate policy, making it next to impossible to survive unless people agree to go to Russia . Denisova reports that an international commission is being created with the participation of the human rights ombudspersons in countries sharing borders with Russia . A few people have, in fact, already managed to return to Ukraine thanks to arrangements involving such third party countries. On 12 April, the Mariupol city authorities posted \u2018an invitation\u2019 issued by the Russians aimed at getting Mariupol residents to settle in Siberia , Sakhalin or other places that Russia has difficulty finding people to work in. They noted that Russia first destroys a successful and warm city on the Sea of Azov, and then drives its residents to Siberia or Sakhalin to work as cheap labour. \u201cSo how does this differ from Hitler\u2019s policy?\u201d, the Council asked.

Russia is housing an estimated 5,000 at a temporary camp in Bezimenne, east of Mariupol, seen in satellite images. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 40,000 had been moved from Ukraine to Russian-held territory without any coordination with Kyiv. A Mariupol refugee, now in Russia, said: \"All of us were taken forcibly\". Some Ukrainian officials describe Russia's actions as \"deportations\" to \"filtration camps\" - an echo of Russia's war in Chechnya, when thousands of Chechens were brutally interrogated in makeshift camps and many disappeared. Maps/Bezimenne, \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0456\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430, Novoazovsk Raion, Donetsk Oblast, 87660, Ukraine It is an internationally-recognised abuse of human rights for a warring party to deport civilians to its territory. While 140,000 civilians have managed to escape from besieged Mariupol, another 170,000 are still trapped there, the city council says. Relentless Russian shelling for more than three weeks has reduced the city to ruins, its terrified civilians hiding in cellars, desperately short of water, food and medicine. The BBC is unable to independently verify the figures for civilians evacuated from Mariupol, or the number killed there. Relatively few Mariupol civilians have fled via the humanitarian corridors agreed by both sides. Ukraine says Russian troops continued shelling the evacuation routes, which were supposed to be safe. In parts of Mariupol captured by the Russians, reports suggest the civilians - hungry, thirsty and often sick - have little choice but to head out to Russian-controlled areas and Russia itself. Matt Morris, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said the ICRC could only evacuate civilians and deliver aid if Russia and Ukraine provided safety guarantees, and that had not happened yet, though the ICRC was speaking to both sides. \"The sides have to be the guarantors and have an agreement to allow safe passage. They have to publicise the route and allow plenty of time for people to get out,\" he told the BBC. International humanitarian law, he said, \"requires that people should be allowed to leave, but should not be forced to leave\". Warring sides should allow aid in and let people stay if they want to, he explained. \"It's a desperate situation in Mariupol - we've called on all sides to facilitate safe access in and out,\" he said, adding: \"We don't have a team currently able to access.\" Irina, a Mariupol refugee and Red Cross volunteer, spoke to the BBC's Wyre Davies via Zoom from a relative's home in Russia. She said she and others sheltering in a bunker had been told to leave by Russian soldiers, for their own safety. The building was on fire after being shelled. They walked 4km (2.5 miles) to a Russian [[checkpoint|checkpoint]], and from there were taken further east, to territory held by pro-Russian rebels of the so-called \"Donetsk People's Republic\" (DPR) breakaway region. \"Once there, you were to decide whether you were going to stay in the DPR or go to Russia,\" she said. \"Some elderly people that I know and whom I met at the distribution point did not know where they were headed and what for. They thought they would be able to stay in Rostov [in Russia] for a couple of months\u2026 and then maybe come back to Mariupol. \"Instead, they were taken to Samara [north of Rostov, in southern Russia]. They said they had no idea what to do there, and the accommodation there is provided only for two weeks.\" Centuries-old ties between Russia and Ukraine mean that many Ukrainians have relatives in Russia. But it is not clear how many Mariupol refugees have gone willingly to Russia, whose army destroyed their city. Russia's government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported on 21 March that a long column of refugees' vehicles had taken more than two hours to reach Bezimenne , a coastal village 90km (56 miles) east of Mariupol. About 5,000 refugees are being housed there, in tents , a school and a club . The Russian emergencies ministry has sent aid and workers to the scene. On the way, the civilians were stopped by DPR rebels at checkpoints, who took their fingerprints and photographed them. \"Their data is checked on a database of wanted criminals. One of the key problems is the shortage of sim cards and not everyone has a mobile phone,\" the newspaper reported. Russia denies it is forcibly removing thousands of Ukrainians from their country. Mariupol's deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC that in his city \"some are dying from dehydration and lack of food; some are dying from lack of medicine, insulin\". Many bodies have been left lying in the streets, as collecting them is so risky. \"Russian soldiers just open [enter] this shelter and tell them: 'look, you have five minutes to evacuate in this direction. Just go, walk five or three or seven kilometres and the buses will transfer you to temporarily controlled territory [by Russia]. If you don't go this house will be bombed in an hour',\" he said. Dozens of Mariupol refugees are staying in a sports centre in Taganrog , a Russian city between Mariupol and Rostov. Russian media report that hundreds have also been sent by train more than 1,000km (600 miles) north to the Russian regions of Yaroslavl and Ryazan . Ukraine's defence ministry says Russia is relocating Ukrainians from occupied areas en masse to distant parts of Russia, including Sakhalin in the far east. \"After passing the filtration camps Ukrainians are sent to economically depressive areas of the Russian Federation. A number of northern regions are called as a final destination, in particular - Sakhalin . Ukrainians are 'offered' official employment through employment centres. Those who agree receive documents banning leaving Russian regions for two years,\" the ministry said on Facebook. Ukraine has urged the ICRC not to open an office in Rostov-on-Don - something reportedly under discussion with the Russian Red Cross. Ukraine says it could be used to legitimise deportations. But the ICRC insisted it \"does not want to open an office in southern Russia to 'filter' Ukrainians, as many reports are alleging\". \"This is not our role, we don't do this. We are not opening a refugee camp.\" The ICRC says it \"does not ever help organise or carry out forced evacuations\", and has only helped in two evacuations so far - from Sumy , a besieged city in the north, to other Ukrainian-held territory. \"We would not support any operation that would go against people's will and our principles,\" the ICRC said.","title":"Russia transfers thousands of Mariupol civilians to its territory"},{"location":"notes/Russia%20transfers%20thousands%20of%20Mariupol%20civilians%20to%20its%20territory/#russia-transfers-thousands-of-mariupol-civilians-to-its-territory","text":"By Laurence Peter BBC News Published 27 March Image source, EPA Image caption, Maps/Taganrog, Rostov Oblast, Southern Federal District, Russia Ukraine has accused Russia of forcibly relocating thousands of civilians from Mariupol, the strategic port city devastated by Russian shelling.

Ukraine has urged the ICRC not to open an office in Rostov-on-Don - something reportedly under discussion with the Russian Red Cross. Ukraine says it could be used to legitimise deportations. But the ICRC insisted it \"does not want to open an office in southern Russia to 'filter' Ukrainians, as many reports are alleging\". \"This is not our role, we don't do this. We are not opening a refugee camp.\" The ICRC says it \"does not ever help organise or carry out forced evacuations\", and has only helped in two evacuations so far - from Sumy , a besieged city in the north, to other Ukrainian-held territory. \"We would not support any operation that would go against people's will and our principles,\" the ICRC said.","title":"Russia transfers thousands of Mariupol civilians to its territory"},{"location":"notes/Russia%20uses%20terror%20and%20abduction%20in%20attempt%20to%20force%20schools%20to%20collaborate%20in%20occupied%20Melitopol/","text":"Russia uses terror and abduction in attempt to force schools to collaborate in occupied Melitopol https://khpg.org/en/1608810509","title":"Russia uses terror and abduction in attempt to force schools to collaborate in occupied Melitopol"},{"location":"notes/Russia/","text":"","title":"Russia"},{"location":"notes/Russian%20Airfields/","text":"Russian Air Bases \u00b6 Airfield Military District ICAO Latitude Longitude Afrikanda Leningrad Akthubinsk North-Caucasian Alabino Moscow Alakurtti Leningrad Alekseyevka Far Eastern Andreapol Moscow Apatity Leningrad Aramil Volga-Ural Arkhangelsk -

According to the Defense Ministry, some 80 airfields with runways longer than 1800 meters would remain open. The airfields' closure may free scarce budget funds for the maintenance and reconstruction of the remaining airfields, the bulk of which were constructed during the 1950s through 1970s and have exceeded their expected service life. Russian airbases generally have their own energy plant apart from the connection to the normal power grid, and of course plenty of mobile generators. During mid 1993 at a Russian air base at Akhtubinsk, near Astrakhan, on the Volga River, a display of aircraft was permitted and only a few journalists new about it to come. Akhtubinsk air base up until this point was a \"closed\" facility for the testing or air weapons. On 21 February 1994 five armed men forced their way into the guardhouse of the Russian air base at Amari (Suurkula), searched for weapons, and burned down the post. The base was the last airfield still under Russian military control from which combat aircraft had been removed, but was still frequently used by military transport planes . The Russian Foreign Ministry delivered an official protest to Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn, demanding exhaustive explanations from Estonia and punishment for the organizers and participants in the attack that was described as an \"extremely dangerous deliberate action which may lead to unpredictable consequences.\" The Ukrainian defense ministry protested the alleged planned takeover of over 20 TU-22M Backfire aircraft by Russia in upcoming Black Sea Fleet military exercises on 4 May 1994. According to the defense ministry, Russia planned to have the planes , which belong to the naval aviation arm of the Black Sea Fleet, fly out of their air bases at Oktyabrskoye and Vesoloye in Crimea to the Russian air base at Krymsk in Krasnodar krai . The Ukrainian defense ministry said that any attempt to transfer military technology or other Black Sea Fleet assets outside Ukraine would be regarded as illegal acts by Ukraine and would worsen the problem of dividing the fleet. Andrei Grachev, head of the Black Sea Fleet press center, denied that there was any truth to the allegation. According to Grachev the charge was a \"figment of the imagination\" of the Ukrainian defense ministry. The Russian Defence Minister, Army General Sergei Shoigu said in Ausut 2015 that about 100 airports used by armed forces of Russia require major repairs or reconstruction. \"Currently, aerospace forces used 125 airfields. Of these, 80% need major repairs or reconstruction,\" - the minister said at a conference at the National Control Center of Defense of Russia. In this regard, said Shoigu, until 2020 provided reconstruction and repair of 108 airfields. \"State aerodrome is directly related to safety,\" - said the head of the military department. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation will carry out a large-scale reconstruction of the aerodrome network in the interests of more operational use of aviation and its safe operation. This was announced by the head of department, Sergei Shoigu, at a meeting of the board of the Ministry of Defense 26 April 2019. According to him, the Ministry of Defense is preparing a draft plan for the repair and reconstruction of 106 airfields. In particular, the minister said, it is planned to repair more than 13 million square meters. m artificial airfields. In addition, more than 700 power supply facilities, air traffic control, aircraft maintenance and repair will be built, as well as an infrastructure has been created for promising airline complexes. Shoigu stressed that \"the further development of the airfield network of the armed forces will allow for more operational use of aviation and its safe operation.\" The minister said that this work is carried out within the framework of the plan, its action is calculated until 2028. Shoigu said that over the past five years, artificial runways of 12 airfields were reconstructed: Vityazevo, Akhtubinsk, Eisk, Krymsk, Korenovsk, Lipetsk, Privolzhsky, Mozdok, Severomorsk-1, Chkalovsky, Chkalovsk and Engels. Currently, work is continuing on another four airfields - Steppe, Baltimore, Temp and Nagurskaya, the minister said, stressing that two of them are located in the Arctic zone. Shoigu also said that this year it is planned to commission six modern aircraft simulators at the airfields of Domna, Vyazma, Morozovsk, Torzhok, Pushkin and Ryazan. \u00a9 2000-2022 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

According to the Defense Ministry, some 80 airfields with runways longer than 1800 meters would remain open. The airfields' closure may free scarce budget funds for the maintenance and reconstruction of the remaining airfields, the bulk of which were constructed during the 1950s through 1970s and have exceeded their expected service life. Russian airbases generally have their own energy plant apart from the connection to the normal power grid, and of course plenty of mobile generators. During mid 1993 at a Russian air base at Akhtubinsk, near Astrakhan, on the Volga River, a display of aircraft was permitted and only a few journalists new about it to come. Akhtubinsk air base up until this point was a \"closed\" facility for the testing or air weapons. On 21 February 1994 five armed men forced their way into the guardhouse of the Russian air base at Amari (Suurkula), searched for weapons, and burned down the post. The base was the last airfield still under Russian military control from which combat aircraft had been removed, but was still frequently used by military transport planes . The Russian Foreign Ministry delivered an official protest to Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn, demanding exhaustive explanations from Estonia and punishment for the organizers and participants in the attack that was described as an \"extremely dangerous deliberate action which may lead to unpredictable consequences.\" The Ukrainian defense ministry protested the alleged planned takeover of over 20 TU-22M Backfire aircraft by Russia in upcoming Black Sea Fleet military exercises on 4 May 1994. According to the defense ministry, Russia planned to have the planes , which belong to the naval aviation arm of the Black Sea Fleet, fly out of their air bases at Oktyabrskoye and Vesoloye in Crimea to the Russian air base at Krymsk in Krasnodar krai . The Ukrainian defense ministry said that any attempt to transfer military technology or other Black Sea Fleet assets outside Ukraine would be regarded as illegal acts by Ukraine and would worsen the problem of dividing the fleet. Andrei Grachev, head of the Black Sea Fleet press center, denied that there was any truth to the allegation. According to Grachev the charge was a \"figment of the imagination\" of the Ukrainian defense ministry. The Russian Defence Minister, Army General Sergei Shoigu said in Ausut 2015 that about 100 airports used by armed forces of Russia require major repairs or reconstruction. \"Currently, aerospace forces used 125 airfields. Of these, 80% need major repairs or reconstruction,\" - the minister said at a conference at the National Control Center of Defense of Russia. In this regard, said Shoigu, until 2020 provided reconstruction and repair of 108 airfields. \"State aerodrome is directly related to safety,\" - said the head of the military department. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation will carry out a large-scale reconstruction of the aerodrome network in the interests of more operational use of aviation and its safe operation. This was announced by the head of department, Sergei Shoigu, at a meeting of the board of the Ministry of Defense 26 April 2019. According to him, the Ministry of Defense is preparing a draft plan for the repair and reconstruction of 106 airfields. In particular, the minister said, it is planned to repair more than 13 million square meters. m artificial airfields. In addition, more than 700 power supply facilities, air traffic control, aircraft maintenance and repair will be built, as well as an infrastructure has been created for promising airline complexes. Shoigu stressed that \"the further development of the airfield network of the armed forces will allow for more operational use of aviation and its safe operation.\" The minister said that this work is carried out within the framework of the plan, its action is calculated until 2028. Shoigu said that over the past five years, artificial runways of 12 airfields were reconstructed: Vityazevo, Akhtubinsk, Eisk, Krymsk, Korenovsk, Lipetsk, Privolzhsky, Mozdok, Severomorsk-1, Chkalovsky, Chkalovsk and Engels. Currently, work is continuing on another four airfields - Steppe, Baltimore, Temp and Nagurskaya, the minister said, stressing that two of them are located in the Arctic zone. Shoigu also said that this year it is planned to commission six modern aircraft simulators at the airfields of Domna, Vyazma, Morozovsk, Torzhok, Pushkin and Ryazan. \u00a9 2000-2022 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

One such area is armaments and military equipment (ART). Since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war in 2014, Russia has been actively boasting of a strong scientific base and the possibility of creating leading technological weapons. In addition, at the same time, due to sanctions, the Kremlin decided to take a course to replace imports with goods produced in Russia. But many of the weapons that were considered the \"pride of the nation\" simply could not function without foreign components. According to researchers from the American Robert Lansing Institute, Russia's 2019 optoelectronic night-range binoculars contain a compass from the Swiss company Vectronix. In addition, the device uses a thermal imaging matrix Ulis Pico manufactured by the French company Lyndred. Also in the seized Russian modern military radio stations R-168-5UT-2 found chips of American production. In addition, more than a thousand Russian tanks have been modified by 2020 in cooperation with the French electronics manufacturer Thales. Moreover, Thales has also equipped the navigation systems of 60 Russian Su-30CM fighters. Tornado MLRS munitions also use components from the United States for navigation, Even the 9M727 cruise missiles launched from the Iskander-K complex use six of the seven connections that provide data transmission via the heat shield of the US-made missile control system, according to a study by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). \"Russia's advanced weapons and communications systems are based on Western chips,\" said Damien Splitters, a specialist at Conflict Armament Research, a non-governmental organization that identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition. After 24 February 2022, the sanctions became even more strict. This even helped to stop the only tank plant in Russia . The Russian manufacturer of anti- aircraft missile systems Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant also suspended its work. Concern VKO Almaz-Antey on the basis of production activity in 2017 for the first time entered the top ten of the world's largest manufacturers of military products, taking eighth place in the Top-100 ranking of the American specialized weekly Defense News in August 2018. Almaz-Antey, engaged in the development and production of antiaircraft and anti-missile defense, has risen in the ranking by three positions at once: from 11th to eighth place. According to the weekly, the company's revenues in 2017 amounted to $ 9.1 billion, an increase of 39% compared to 2016. In addition to the Almaz-Antey concern, five other Russian companies entered the world rating of the 100 largest enterprises of the MIC. The United aircraft Corporation retained the 14th place with the figure of $ 6.1 billion. The Tactical Missile Armament Corporation moved up from 32nd to 25th place, earning $ 3.5 bn in 2017. The Russian company Helicopters of Russia took the 36th line in the rating of the magazine with an indicator of $ 2.7 billion. According to the American newspaper, the Russian manufacturer of tanks [[JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod imeni F.E.Dzerzhinsky|Uralvagonzavod]] in 2017 increased its revenues by 18% - to $ 1.8 billion - and ranked 46th among the world's arms producers. With a small gap from it on the 48th place in the rating was placed \"Concern\" Radioelectronic Technologies \"(KRET) with a result of $ 1.6 billion. The rating of the world's largest manufacturers of military products \"Top-100\" is compiled by Defense News since 2000 and is one of the most authoritative in the world. The distribution of seats in this rating is made depending on the volume of companies' revenues from military products. Six Russian companies were among the 100 largest manufacturers of military products according to the American weekly Defense News, which specializes in news on military topics. The leader of the companies from the Russian Federation was again the concern of the East-Kazakhstan region Almaz-Antey. Defense News has been making this rating since 2000. At the end of 2016, a hundred included Almaz-Antey (11th with revenues of $ 7.412 billion, the year before the concern was also 11th with revenues of $ 6.965 billion), United aircraft Corporation (14th place with revenue of $ 5.636 billion, a year earlier The corporation was the 16th with revenues of $ 4.643 billion), the Tactical Missile Arms Corporation (32nd place with proceeds of $ 2.866 billion, last year the corporation was the 37th with revenue of $ 2.387 billion), [[JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod imeni F.E.Dzerzhinsky|Uralvagonzavod]] (45th place with revenue In $ 1.584 billion, a year earlier the company was the 60th with revenues of $ 1.014 billion), the concern \"Radioelectronic Technologies\" (50th place with revenue At $ 1.365 billion, the year before the concern was the 48th with revenues of $ 1.678 billion), as well as RTI (86th place with revenue of $ 565.9 million, The present condition of Russia's defense sector is critical, and the reasons are well known. One is the aging of highly qualified production personnel, many of whom are approaching retirement age. Engineering school graduates are unwilling to take jobs in the defense sector because of low wages. No worker replacements are trained anywhere in the country either. Earlier, it was taboo to draft workers from defense factories into the army. Now this privilege is abandoned, and graduates of the few surviving vocational schools seek employment elsewhere, but not in the defense sector where receiving a foreign travel passport is a problem. Another problem is the aging of the equipment in the defense industry: its production lines and machine tools have long passed the 30-year limit. Many key technologies have been lost as have co-production links. The uncontrolled growth of energy costs is outstripping inflation and is well above the deflators provided by the Economic Development and Trade Ministry. It was obvious that the 2006-2015 government defense order would fall short in both the range and quality of products ordered. The basis of the classification of enterprises is the numbering system of defense plants (No. 1, 2, etc.), which was introduced in 1927. due to the increased requirements for the secrecy of defense production. This system provided for the through numbering of defense plants of all industries and henceforth excluded the coincidence of the numbers of enterprises of different departments. Prior to this factories in many industries also had digital signs. Thus, the aircraft building enterprises had the name\ufffdState aircraft Plant\ufffd(GAZ) with serial numbers from 1 to 16. But these were only interdepartmental (within a trust or association) serial numbers that did not aim to hide the specialization and location of the enterprise. In 1927 the first enterprises received serial numbers starting from the 1st (according to the first order of the Supreme Economic Council / NKVM / OGPU on renaming - No. 73cc from 9. 07.1927g., License plates received 30 factories). In the future, newly formed or transferred to the defense industry enterprises received subsequent numbers. When liquidating or merging several enterprises into one (which was a mass phenomenon during the evacuation in 1941-42), the released numbers were assigned to newly formed enterprises. This system operated until the mid-1960s, when the numbers of defense plants moved well beyond 1000. The numbering of research organizations (CBIs) and design bureaus was mainly free from the rules except for one factory operating under the designation: the institute number could not coincide (with rare exceptions) with the scientific research institute number of another department. For example, with education in 12.1936g. The NCPC, all the institutes and bureaus incorporated into it, received consecutive numbers from 1 to 29 (except for No. 20, which was planned to be assigned to the IRPA, but not done). Research institutes formed on the basis of plants, as a rule, received the numbers of these plants. This numbering system operated until the mid-1960s, then until 1966-67. all defense enterprises received open own names. Beginning about 1964, ob'edineniia or associations of enterprises began to be formed again (they were used in the 1920s, but were dropped in the early 1930s). And in 1968, scientific-production associations began to be formed. These are composed of at least one R&D institute, with engineering design subdivisionst and production enterprises intended to put the newly developed products into batch production. The associations were greatly strengthened by government legislation in the spring of 1974. Clearly, these scientific-production associations represented a potentially significant organizational break in the R&D production chain. The Russian Federation inherited the largest and most productive share of the former Soviet defense industry, employing as many as 9 million workers in 1,125 to 1,500 research, design, and production facilities. Russian defense industry wage increases had not kept pace with inflation, meaning that most Russian defense enterprises had steadily lost their best workers (estimates ranged from 800,000 to 1 million lost per year) to Western companies or the emerging Russian private sector. In 1997 the Russian defense industry consisted of over 1,700 firms and nominally employed some 2.5 million workers. While defense enterprises were found throughout the country, a significant portion was concentrated in a dozen cities and regions, where over one-third of the labor force worked in defense. Those installations were concentrated in particular regions, whose economies tend to be heavily dependent on the industry; in the Republic of Udmurtia, for example, more than two-thirds of workers and industrial capacity were attached to defense in some way in the early 1990s. Moscow has large plants for air force and missile components, and St. Petersburg specializes in naval design and production as well as infantry weapons. A Russian defense plant was, in some ways, a throw-back to a US factory-town. A \"town-forming enterprise\" completely provides for urban activity and permanently participates in different programs of social purposes. Such a defense plant is really a mini-city in itself, with its own apartments, doctors, clinics, restaurants, and power plants. Outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg, defense plant employees frequently live in company apartments, shop in company stores, and eat in company cafeterias. In the 1990s up to 80 percent of a defense plant's budget went to maintaining these social services. The plant manager was often as concerned with making deals to bring in potatoes and bread to feed his people as with joint venture agreements, and these and other transactions were often conducted on a barter-basis. In a town-forming enterprise, the life and prosperity of citizens depended on stable work for the enterprise. A town-forming enterprise concerns itself with creation of more jobs, and so would establish productions line outside the mainstream business. In the 1990s plant managers often attempted to maintain production even without budget authority to keep workers busy. This led to an excess inventory of weapons, which plant managers tried to sell, even as the downsizing armed forces also sought to sell off now surplus military equipment. By the mid-1990s most Russian defense enterprises would have been considered bankrupt in Western terms, and the situation worsened after the financial collapse of 1998. The Ministry of Economy reported that 400 defense enterprises were unable to pay their debts. The industry needed modernization and many defense enterprise managers were eager to learn about the basics of marketing, finance, and modern business practices. Many defense plants reduced operations to only a few days per week at most. The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union covered the period 1991-1995. The Sixteenth Five-Year Plan would have covered 2006-2010, and the Seventeenth Five-Year Plan would have covered 2011-2015. It would appear that the demise of the Soviet Union did not erase the penchant for Five Year Plans, since both the Yeltsin and Putin governments released new long range plans every five years, coinciding with the intervals that would have been covered by the Soviet Five-Year Plan. In the United States, the conterpart activity is the Quadrennial Defense Review, on four year centers. Up to 90% of all machine tools are imported to Russia from abroad. The most critical is, according to experts, first of all, for the production of ammunition. How bitterly says one expert, Yuri Shabalin, \"now own the machine tool in the ammunition industry, we do not exist in the country.\" According to the same Shabalin, in the defense industry is now working half of CNC systems are imported. And, in his opinion, \"for you can turn off a specific signal is CNC or set wrong program.\" Like it or not, but its machine tool industry and its machine tool industry in Russia in fact is no more. However, there are no people who could work on these machines. As recognized by the general director of \"[[JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod imeni F.E.Dzerzhinsky|Uralvagonzavod]]\" Oleg Sienko in 2015, \"we really did not have and do not have enough skilled workers. First of all - operators of CNC machine tools, without which it is impossible to conduct a global re-equipment.\" By the way, he also listed some of the areas where entrusted to him tankostroitelnoe leading enterprise in the country suffered losses from the sanctions and the lack of supply of imported components: \"We are under sanctions, it means that foreign banks and suppliers can not come into contact with us. We take very seriously worked on the creation of a locomotive with Caterpillar. But two days before the shipment of the products made at the site of our partners in Latin America, the sanctions were imposed. With Renault Truck Defense we have made a good car, intended for export. And our military liked it too. But we were forced to stop these processes. With Bombardier we have the same situation\u2026.Byli program and with other international partners, we are forced to fold. \" \"Import substitution is very important, but it can be done any day or a year or even five years - realistically acknowledged CEO of\" [[JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod imeni F.E.Dzerzhinsky|Uralvagonzavod]] \", - the competence of something we have lost. We need to replace the process of the twentieth century in the process of the twenty-first century\u2026. But leave it years. We'll have a long time to catch up with what has been done in the world.\" Because if we want to create the best product, \"we can not sure a top manager, to create one of the worst materials using poor equipment. The entire chain should consist of the best units.\" On 23 August 2020, the Army-2020 International Military-Technical Forum and the International Army Games opened. This year, the forum became the first international convention and exhibition event in the field of defense, and despite the coronavirus restrictions, international experts attended it. An important aspect of the IMTF, which is often overlooked in ceremonial reports, is a kind of report to Russian taxpayers. It is clear that an ordinary person will not be allowed to the secrets of defense accounting and at the enterprises of the defense industry no one will reveal closed budget items. However, a citizen interested in national security and defense issues can get much more information, especially on some specific sectors, as a result of visiting open areas, pavilions and stands at the Army forum than listening to the announcer's text during the Victory Parade. \ufffdThe international military-technical forums\ufffdArmy\ufffdare of great importance as the propaganda of the Russian Armed Forces, the achievements of domestic military construction and the defense-industrial complex,\ufffdsaid Mikhail Barabanov, deputy director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. According to the expert, there is a big and positive contrast here in comparison with Soviet times, when such propaganda, in fact, was not carried out. This led to a belittling in the mass consciousness of the importance and role of the Armed Forces, a widespread opinion by the end of the USSR that we were backward from the West in military organizational development and in military equipment. \ufffdNow everything is different, and domestic military achievements are widely used for patriotic propaganda. As a result, the Army forums have taken an important place in this system, and at its present level,\ufffdbelieves Mikhail Barabanov. \"The IMTF\" ??Army \"is of great importance as an exhibition of domestic defense products, including for the promotion of these products on the world market in the form of export offers. Thus, such forums play an important role in the system of military-technical cooperation, becoming a kind of Russian counterpart to the exhibitions in Le Bourget and Farnborough. The MAKS air shows, after all, have not been able to reach this level,\ufffdsays Mikhail Barabanov. Copyright \u00a9 2000-2022 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

One such area is armaments and military equipment (ART). Since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war in 2014, Russia has been actively boasting of a strong scientific base and the possibility of creating leading technological weapons. In addition, at the same time, due to sanctions, the Kremlin decided to take a course to replace imports with goods produced in Russia. But many of the weapons that were considered the \"pride of the nation\" simply could not function without foreign components. According to researchers from the American Robert Lansing Institute, Russia's 2019 optoelectronic night-range binoculars contain a compass from the Swiss company Vectronix. In addition, the device uses a thermal imaging matrix Ulis Pico manufactured by the French company Lyndred. Also in the seized Russian modern military radio stations R-168-5UT-2 found chips of American production. In addition, more than a thousand Russian tanks have been modified by 2020 in cooperation with the French electronics manufacturer Thales. Moreover, Thales has also equipped the navigation systems of 60 Russian Su-30CM fighters. Tornado MLRS munitions also use components from the United States for navigation, Even the 9M727 cruise missiles launched from the Iskander-K complex use six of the seven connections that provide data transmission via the heat shield of the US-made missile control system, according to a study by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). \"Russia's advanced weapons and communications systems are based on Western chips,\" said Damien Splitters, a specialist at Conflict Armament Research, a non-governmental organization that identifies and tracks weapons and ammunition. After 24 February 2022, the sanctions became even more strict. This even helped to stop the only tank plant in Russia . The Russian manufacturer of anti- aircraft missile systems Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant also suspended its work. Concern VKO Almaz-Antey on the basis of production activity in 2017 for the first time entered the top ten of the world's largest manufacturers of military products, taking eighth place in the Top-100 ranking of the American specialized weekly Defense News in August 2018. Almaz-Antey, engaged in the development and production of antiaircraft and anti-missile defense, has risen in the ranking by three positions at once: from 11th to eighth place. According to the weekly, the company's revenues in 2017 amounted to $ 9.1 billion, an increase of 39% compared to 2016. In addition to the Almaz-Antey concern, five other Russian companies entered the world rating of the 100 largest enterprises of the MIC. The United aircraft Corporation retained the 14th place with the figure of $ 6.1 billion. The Tactical Missile Armament Corporation moved up from 32nd to 25th place, earning $ 3.5 bn in 2017. The Russian company Helicopters of Russia took the 36th line in the rating of the magazine with an indicator of $ 2.7 billion. According to the American newspaper, the Russian manufacturer of tanks [[JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod imeni F.E.Dzerzhinsky|Uralvagonzavod]] in 2017 increased its revenues by 18% - to $ 1.8 billion - and ranked 46th among the world's arms producers. With a small gap from it on the 48th place in the rating was placed \"Concern\" Radioelectronic Technologies \"(KRET) with a result of $ 1.6 billion. The rating of the world's largest manufacturers of military products \"Top-100\" is compiled by Defense News since 2000 and is one of the most authoritative in the world. The distribution of seats in this rating is made depending on the volume of companies' revenues from military products. Six Russian companies were among the 100 largest manufacturers of military products according to the American weekly Defense News, which specializes in news on military topics. The leader of the companies from the Russian Federation was again the concern of the East-Kazakhstan region Almaz-Antey. Defense News has been making this rating since 2000. At the end of 2016, a hundred included Almaz-Antey (11th with revenues of $ 7.412 billion, the year before the concern was also 11th with revenues of $ 6.965 billion), United aircraft Corporation (14th place with revenue of $ 5.636 billion, a year earlier The corporation was the 16th with revenues of $ 4.643 billion), the Tactical Missile Arms Corporation (32nd place with proceeds of $ 2.866 billion, last year the corporation was the 37th with revenue of $ 2.387 billion), [[JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod imeni F.E.Dzerzhinsky|Uralvagonzavod]] (45th place with revenue In $ 1.584 billion, a year earlier the company was the 60th with revenues of $ 1.014 billion), the concern \"Radioelectronic Technologies\" (50th place with revenue At $ 1.365 billion, the year before the concern was the 48th with revenues of $ 1.678 billion), as well as RTI (86th place with revenue of $ 565.9 million, The present condition of Russia's defense sector is critical, and the reasons are well known. One is the aging of highly qualified production personnel, many of whom are approaching retirement age. Engineering school graduates are unwilling to take jobs in the defense sector because of low wages. No worker replacements are trained anywhere in the country either. Earlier, it was taboo to draft workers from defense factories into the army. Now this privilege is abandoned, and graduates of the few surviving vocational schools seek employment elsewhere, but not in the defense sector where receiving a foreign travel passport is a problem. Another problem is the aging of the equipment in the defense industry: its production lines and machine tools have long passed the 30-year limit. Many key technologies have been lost as have co-production links. The uncontrolled growth of energy costs is outstripping inflation and is well above the deflators provided by the Economic Development and Trade Ministry. It was obvious that the 2006-2015 government defense order would fall short in both the range and quality of products ordered. The basis of the classification of enterprises is the numbering system of defense plants (No. 1, 2, etc.), which was introduced in 1927. due to the increased requirements for the secrecy of defense production. This system provided for the through numbering of defense plants of all industries and henceforth excluded the coincidence of the numbers of enterprises of different departments. Prior to this factories in many industries also had digital signs. Thus, the aircraft building enterprises had the name\ufffdState aircraft Plant\ufffd(GAZ) with serial numbers from 1 to 16. But these were only interdepartmental (within a trust or association) serial numbers that did not aim to hide the specialization and location of the enterprise. In 1927 the first enterprises received serial numbers starting from the 1st (according to the first order of the Supreme Economic Council / NKVM / OGPU on renaming - No. 73cc from 9. 07.1927g., License plates received 30 factories). In the future, newly formed or transferred to the defense industry enterprises received subsequent numbers. When liquidating or merging several enterprises into one (which was a mass phenomenon during the evacuation in 1941-42), the released numbers were assigned to newly formed enterprises. This system operated until the mid-1960s, when the numbers of defense plants moved well beyond 1000. The numbering of research organizations (CBIs) and design bureaus was mainly free from the rules except for one factory operating under the designation: the institute number could not coincide (with rare exceptions) with the scientific research institute number of another department. For example, with education in 12.1936g. The NCPC, all the institutes and bureaus incorporated into it, received consecutive numbers from 1 to 29 (except for No. 20, which was planned to be assigned to the IRPA, but not done). Research institutes formed on the basis of plants, as a rule, received the numbers of these plants. This numbering system operated until the mid-1960s, then until 1966-67. all defense enterprises received open own names. Beginning about 1964, ob'edineniia or associations of enterprises began to be formed again (they were used in the 1920s, but were dropped in the early 1930s). And in 1968, scientific-production associations began to be formed. These are composed of at least one R&D institute, with engineering design subdivisionst and production enterprises intended to put the newly developed products into batch production. The associations were greatly strengthened by government legislation in the spring of 1974. Clearly, these scientific-production associations represented a potentially significant organizational break in the R&D production chain. The Russian Federation inherited the largest and most productive share of the former Soviet defense industry, employing as many as 9 million workers in 1,125 to 1,500 research, design, and production facilities. Russian defense industry wage increases had not kept pace with inflation, meaning that most Russian defense enterprises had steadily lost their best workers (estimates ranged from 800,000 to 1 million lost per year) to Western companies or the emerging Russian private sector. In 1997 the Russian defense industry consisted of over 1,700 firms and nominally employed some 2.5 million workers. While defense enterprises were found throughout the country, a significant portion was concentrated in a dozen cities and regions, where over one-third of the labor force worked in defense. Those installations were concentrated in particular regions, whose economies tend to be heavily dependent on the industry; in the Republic of Udmurtia, for example, more than two-thirds of workers and industrial capacity were attached to defense in some way in the early 1990s. Moscow has large plants for air force and missile components, and St. Petersburg specializes in naval design and production as well as infantry weapons. A Russian defense plant was, in some ways, a throw-back to a US factory-town. A \"town-forming enterprise\" completely provides for urban activity and permanently participates in different programs of social purposes.

Having failed in their opening salvo against Kyiv, Russian forces have settled into a grinding campaign in other parts of the country, using artillery bombardments in advance of slowly moving infantry. There is nothing elegant about their approach. After years of speculation about hybrid warfare and grey-zone tactics , Russia has reverted to form. Its offensive cyberspace operations have been particularly marginal to its conventional military effort. Open sources suggest that Russia has rarely used destructive malware since the February invasion. Over the same period it fired millions of bullets, artillery shells, and rockets, with devastating effect. As Michael Kofman put it, \u201cThis is a heavy metal war.\u201d This has surprised many observers, who thought the war would follow a different path. I was one of them. I suspected that Russia would open the war with a burst of cyberspace operations designed to hobble Ukrainian communications and make it impossible for Kyiv to organize a coherent defense. It\u2019s easy to see the allure of such a concept, though I doubted it would succeed because the technical demands are quite high. Nonetheless, Russian military doctrine stresses the importance of information dominance, and analysts have spent years sounding the alarm about the potential for large-scale digital disruption in the event of war. Instead, most Russian efforts appear to be related to espionage and propaganda , with only a smattering of sabotage . Microsoft has issued two on Russian operations. Its data suggests that most Russian activities are about stealing information and influencing the public debate, not incapacitating information systems or causing physical harm. Russia may unleash such operations later, the authors warn, but so far, they have been largely absent. Indeed, it is telling that Microsoft devotes the lion\u2019s share of its June report to Russian propaganda , detailing the ways in which Russian agencies pre-positioned fake stories before the war to make them seem more credible later. Such public methods are easier to track, to be sure, which explains part of why they receive so much attention. But if disruptive operations were so important to Russian cyberspace activities, we should at least see their residue. The June report also suggests a correlation between cyberspace operations and conventional campaigns, highlighting a half-dozen instances in which malware moved on a target in advance of military forces. Yet the link is tenuous in some cases, and in others it appears that Russian cyberspace efforts were simply aimed at gathering information. Efforts to use malware to disable Ukrainian communications, or to cause harm to Ukraine\u2019s foreign supporters, have been infrequent and largely inconsequential. There is little evidence in open sources that Russian cyberspace operations have had a meaningful effect on Ukraine\u2019s combat performance. Nor have they had much effect on the international response. Cyberspace operations, in short, have not played a key role in this war. Why not? Observers have offered a host of plausible explanations. Aid from the United States and the private sector may have provided a critical bulwark against digital aggression, as Microsoft suggests. Or perhaps Ukraine\u2019s defenders were better than expected. Maybe Russia restrained its activities because it feared destroying the networks it would need after occupying the country. Maybe Russia withheld damaging operations against the West because it wants to use the threat of cyberspace attacks to coerce Ukraine\u2019s supporters. Russian cyber activities might have been ineffective because they are too reliant on hackers whose activities the Russian state cannot fully control. Going on the offensive in cyberspace is harder than we thought for these reasons. Defenders have key advantages in a conflict, not least their ability to move information into the cloud and otherwise make their communications redundant. There may be truth in these claims\u2014it is too soon to tell. But there is a simpler explanation. Because cyberspace is an information domain, cyberspace operations are about gaining information advantages. Intelligence agencies scour the domain in search of details that may be useful to strategists, diplomats, and military leaders.

Having failed in their opening salvo against Kyiv, Russian forces have settled into a grinding campaign in other parts of the country, using artillery bombardments in advance of slowly moving infantry. There is nothing elegant about their approach. After years of speculation about hybrid warfare and grey-zone tactics , Russia has reverted to form. Its offensive cyberspace operations have been particularly marginal to its conventional military effort. Open sources suggest that Russia has rarely used destructive malware since the February invasion. Over the same period it fired millions of bullets, artillery shells, and rockets, with devastating effect. As Michael Kofman put it, \u201cThis is a heavy metal war.\u201d This has surprised many observers, who thought the war would follow a different path. I was one of them. I suspected that Russia would open the war with a burst of cyberspace operations designed to hobble Ukrainian communications and make it impossible for Kyiv to organize a coherent defense. It\u2019s easy to see the allure of such a concept, though I doubted it would succeed because the technical demands are quite high. Nonetheless, Russian military doctrine stresses the importance of information dominance, and analysts have spent years sounding the alarm about the potential for large-scale digital disruption in the event of war. Instead, most Russian efforts appear to be related to espionage and propaganda , with only a smattering of sabotage . Microsoft has issued two on Russian operations. Its data suggests that most Russian activities are about stealing information and influencing the public debate, not incapacitating information systems or causing physical harm. Russia may unleash such operations later, the authors warn, but so far, they have been largely absent. Indeed, it is telling that Microsoft devotes the lion\u2019s share of its June report to Russian propaganda , detailing the ways in which Russian agencies pre-positioned fake stories before the war to make them seem more credible later. Such public methods are easier to track, to be sure, which explains part of why they receive so much attention. But if disruptive operations were so important to Russian cyberspace activities, we should at least see their residue. The June report also suggests a correlation between cyberspace operations and conventional campaigns, highlighting a half-dozen instances in which malware moved on a target in advance of military forces. Yet the link is tenuous in some cases, and in others it appears that Russian cyberspace efforts were simply aimed at gathering information. Efforts to use malware to disable Ukrainian communications, or to cause harm to Ukraine\u2019s foreign supporters, have been infrequent and largely inconsequential. There is little evidence in open sources that Russian cyberspace operations have had a meaningful effect on Ukraine\u2019s combat performance. Nor have they had much effect on the international response. Cyberspace operations, in short, have not played a key role in this war. Why not? Observers have offered a host of plausible explanations. Aid from the United States and the private sector may have provided a critical bulwark against digital aggression, as Microsoft suggests. Or perhaps Ukraine\u2019s defenders were better than expected. Maybe Russia restrained its activities because it feared destroying the networks it would need after occupying the country. Maybe Russia withheld damaging operations against the West because it wants to use the threat of cyberspace attacks to coerce Ukraine\u2019s supporters. Russian cyber activities might have been ineffective because they are too reliant on hackers whose activities the Russian state cannot fully control. Going on the offensive in cyberspace is harder than we thought for these reasons. Defenders have key advantages in a conflict, not least their ability to move information into the cloud and otherwise make their communications redundant. There may be truth in these claims\u2014it is too soon to tell. But there is a simpler explanation. Because cyberspace is an information domain, cyberspace operations are about gaining information advantages. Intelligence agencies scour the domain in search of details that may be useful to strategists, diplomats, and military leaders. They want to know about the strength and disposition of enemy forces, as well as the capabilities and intentions of third parties. In this sense, Russian cyberspace activities are no different from intelligence gathering in past conflicts. Espionage\u2014collecting and interpreting secret information to give political and military leaders decision advantage\u2014is key.

It has been a part of Russia since the latter half of the 16th century, after the Russians conquered lands east of the Ural Mountains . Siberia is vast and sparsely populated, covering an area of over 13.1 million square kilometres (5,100,000 sq mi), but home to merely one-fifth of Russia's population. Novosibirsk and Omsk are the largest cities in the region. Because Siberia is a geographic and historic region and not a political entity, there is no single precise definition of its territorial borders. Traditionally, Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, and includes most of the drainage basin of the Arctic Ocean. The river Yenisey divides Siberia into two parts, Western and Eastern. Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and to the northern parts of Mongolia and China. The central part of Siberia (West and East Siberian economic regions) was considered the core part of the region in the Soviet Union. Beyond the core, Siberia's western part includes some territories of the Ural region, the far eastern part has been historically called the Russian Far East.Siberia is known worldwide primarily for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of \u221225 \u00b0C (\u221213 \u00b0F). It is geographically situated in Asia; however, due to it being colonized and incorporated into Russia, it is culturally and politically a part of Europe. European cultural influences, specifically Russian, predominate throughout the region, due to it having had Russian emigration from Europe since the 16th century, forming the Siberian Russian sub-ethnic group. Over 85% of the region's population is of European descent.

The bottle broke on the window bars and caused no damage to the building. The watchman on duty tried to detain the attacker, but he broke free and fled before the police arrived.

Statements Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Situation in Ukraine \u00b6 25 March 2022 Delivered by Ms. Matilda Bogner - Head of Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine on the situation in Ukraine \u00b6 Day after day, the death toll and human suffering in cities, towns and villages across Ukraine is increasing. The facts as we have been reporting speak for themselves: since Russian armed forces launched their attacks on 24 February, at least 1,035 civilians have been killed and at least 1,650 injured. I say \u201cat least\u201d because we do not yet have the full picture of locations that have seen intense fighting, in particular Mariupol and Volnovakha. Military forces have used explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas \u2013 including missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets as well as airstrikes. Private houses, multi-storey residential buildings, administrative buildings, medical and education facilities, water stations, electricity systems have been destroyed on a massive scale, with disastrous effects on civilians and their human rights , including their rights to health, food, water , education and housing. The extent of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian objects strongly suggests that the principles of distinction, of proportionality, the rule on feasible precautions and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks have been violated. To give you two examples: on 3 March, 47 civilians were killed when two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv were destroyed, and all indications are that these were the result of Russian airstrikes. On 9 March, Mariupol Hospital No.3 was destroyed and most likely this also was the result of a Russian airstrike. Seventeen civilians, among them children and pregnant women, were injured. One injured woman was helped to deliver by Caesarean section soon after the attack, but neither she nor her baby survived. The doctors operated on them by candlelight. We are also looking into allegations of indiscriminate shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces in Donetsk and in other territory controlled by the self-proclaimed \u2018republics\u2019. These attacks cause immeasurable human suffering and may amount to war crimes , and they must stop. Since 24 February, we have received allegations of Russian forces shooting at and killing civilians in cars during evacuations, without taking feasible precautions or giving effective advance warning. We are also following up on other allegations that Russian forces have killed civilians, including during peaceful assemblies. We have also received two allegations of killing in Government controlled territory of civilians due to their alleged affiliation with Russian forces or support of pro- Russian views. We have documented 22 cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of local officials in regions under the control of Russian forces, 13 of whom have been subsequently released. We have also documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 15 journalists and civil society activists who vocally opposed the invasion in Kyiv, Kherson , Luhansk , and Zaporizhzhia regions. We are currently trying to verify reports that five of the journalists and three of the activists were subsequently released. The whereabouts of the other individuals remain unknown. We are also concerned by videos depicting prisoners of war being interrogated after their capture by both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Prisoners of war must be treated humanely, not subjected to acts of violence and protected against insults and public curiosity. Since the invasion by the Russian Federation, people believed to be thieves, bootleggers, pro- Russian supporters or curfew violators have been beaten in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine . We have received credible allegations of more than 40 such cases of ill-treatment by police officers, volunteer defence force members and others. This past month has highlighted the absolutely crucial role of journalists in getting the news out in such difficult and dangerous circumstances. But as we have seen, as hostilities intensify, journalists and media workers are facing increasing dangers in their work. So far, 7 journalists and media workers have been killed in Ukraine since 24 February, and 12 have come under armed attack, with six of them injured. At least one journalist is missing, his last known location was in an area of active hostilities. We are deeply concerned about the plight of people who were already in vulnerable situations before the military attack. People with disabilities have struggled to get to bomb shelters or other safe areas. They are also left without access to essential medicines due to the high level of insecurity. Long-term care facilities for people with disabilities, and older people in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions face an appalling humanitarian situation. Amid the fighting and the lack of food, water , heating, electricity, and medication, residents of such facilities are all the more vulnerable as they depend on others for their care and support. You have been hearing from colleagues about the ongoing humanitarian work by the UN in Ukraine . We call on all parties to ensure safe corridors for the evacuation of civilians from dangerous areas and to allow the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population across the country. And just to end, as the Secretary General stated on 22 March, the war is going nowhere \u2013 fast \u2013 and the Ukrainian people are enduring a living hell. It is time to stop the fighting now.

Also included among those being designated is [[Task Force Rusich|Task Force Rusich]], a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated in combat alongside Russia \u2019s military in Ukraine, as well as two of its senior leaders. Today\u2019s action is being taken in coordination with those taken by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is imposing additional export control measures to further align with partners and allies, as well as by the U.S. Department of State, which is targeting Russia \u2019s defense and high-technology industries, as well as proxy authorities. \u201cThe United States will continue to take strong actions to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes , atrocities and aggression,\u201d said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. \u201cAs Ukraine presses forward with defending its freedom, today we\u2019re taking steps to further degrade Russia \u2019s ability to rebuild its military , hold perpetrators of violence accountable, and further financially isolate Putin.\u201d FURTHER ISOLATING RUSSIA \u2019S FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND COUNTERING EVASION In response to Russia \u2019s February 2022 further invasion of Ukraine, the United States and an international coalition of allies and partners took swift action to substantially sever Russia \u2019s access to the world\u2019s financial infrastructure. In response, Russia has scrambled to find new ways to process payments and conduct transactions. Directly and indirectly, Russia \u2019s financial technocrats have supported the Kremlin\u2019s unprovoked war. Today\u2019s designations target those efforts. OFAC is also publishing a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) to provide additional guidance on the heightened risk of facilitating Russia \u2019s efforts to evade sanctions through the expanded use of the National Payment Card System (NSPK) or the Mir National Payment System, given the broad sanctions imposed on Russia \u2019s financial system this year. Vladimir Valerievich Komlev (Komlev) is the Chairman of the Management Board and the Chief Executive Officer of NSPK, a Central Bank of the Russian Federation owned entity that operates the country\u2019s Mir payment card network. Russia created its own state-run card payment system in 2014 out of fear of U.S. and European sanctions. In his role, Komlev has promoted the Mir network in other countries, which ultimately could assist Russia in circumventing international sanctions. Komlev was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy, and for being or having been a leader, official, senior executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the GoR. Viktor Olegovich Zhidkov (Zhidkov) is the Chairman of the Management and Executive Board of Non-Bank Credit Institution Joint Stock Company National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia \u2019s central securities depository. In his role, Zhidkov implements NSD\u2019s development strategy and is responsible for strengthening the depository\u2019s role in Russia \u2019s financial market infrastructure.

HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION AUTHORITIES ABUSING UKRAINIANS Since Russia \u2019s occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine, prosecutors and judges operating as Russia\u2019s occupation authorities in the so-called Republic of Crimea have frequently issued politically motivated decisions, failed to respect fair trial guarantees, and have unjustly targeted religious and ethnic minorities. Sergei Viktorovich Bulgakov (Bulgakov) is the purported \u201cDeputy Prosecutor and Senior Counselor of Justice\u201d for the so-called \u201cRepublic of Crimea.\u201d Bulgakov became the purported \u201cDeputy Prosecutor and Senior Counsel of Justice\u201d for the so-called Republic of Crimea in August 2014. Prior to Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Crimea, Bulgakov was an employee of Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office for Crimea and criminal proceedings were opened against Bulgakov for high treason in Ukraine after he began operating as a proxy of Russia. Bulgakov was designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Andrey Nikolayevich Dolgopolov (Dolgopolov) is the purported Chairman of the Kyiv District Court in Simferopol in the so-called Republic of Crimea, and Mikhail Nikolayevich Belousov (Belousov) and Viktor Anatolyevich Mozhelyanskiy (Mozhelyanskiy) are judges in the same court. The three officials are considered to be the most active of the Kyiv District Court in handing out politically motivated decisions and have been called \u201cmissionaries of the Kremlin.\u201d All three were involved in issuing the judgments against Ukrainian sailors that were captured by Russia\u2019s designated Federal Security Service (FSB) in November 2018 during a raid on a Ukrainian naval vessel. The United Nations raised concerns that the judgments\u2019 failed to comply with the judicial safeguards required for the prosecution of prisoners of war under international humanitarian law. These judges have also issued biased judgments against members of ethnic minority groups in the region, including Crimean Tatars. Dolgopolov, Belousov, and Mozhelyanskiy were designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Dolgopolov, Belousov, and Mozhelyanskiy are also sanctioned by Canada, the EU, and Switzerland. Mariya Gennadevna Ermakova (Ermakova) is installed as a \u201cjudge\u201d in the Dzhankoi District Court of the so-called Republic of Crimea, and Pavel Valerevich Kryllo (Kryllo) is installed as a \u201cjudge\u201d in the Gagarinskiy District Court in Sevastopol. Both installed judges doled out harsh judgments against members of religious minority groups, including Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, based on their exercise of religious freedoms, which is contrary to international human rights law. Ermakova, and Kryllo were designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine. Dmitry Sergeevich Gramashov (Gramashov) is a Russian FSB officer who is wanted by Ukraine\u2019s authorities for illegally operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine and targeting a journalist for repression. Gramashov was also involved in mass searches and arrests of ethnic Crimean Tatars and assisted Russia in its policy of targeting the pro-Ukraine population on the peninsula. Gramashov was designated pursuant to E.O. 13685 for operating in the Crimea region of Ukraine and pursuant to E.O. 13660 for asserting governmental authority over any part or region of Ukraine without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine. PROHIBITION ON QUANTUM COMPUTING SERVICES AND EXPANSION OF SANCTIONS AUTHORITIES Treasury is also taking additional action to cut off Russia\u2019s access to a key service from U.S. companies. Today, OFAC issued a determination pursuant to E.O. 14071 prohibiting the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of quantum computing services to any person located in the Russian Federation. This prohibition will take effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 15, 2022. In conjunction with this determination, OFAC is issuing new guidance. This action complements additional actions taken today by the Department of Commerce, which imposed additional export controls to Russia and Belarus on quantum computing hardware, software, and technology, among other things. In addition, the Department of State imposed further sanctions on Russian companies supporting its quantum computing capabilities, which help support Russia\u2019s war machine. Together these actions by the U.S. government will further degrade Russia\u2019s ability to reconstitute its military with the advanced technology support it has previously relied on from the United States. In parallel with this action, OFAC has identified the quantum computing sector of the Russian Federation economy pursuant to E.O. 14024. This determination allows for sanctions to be imposed on any individual or entity determined to operate or have operated in this sector of the Russian Federation economy and, thereby, expands the United States\u2019 ability to swiftly impose additional economic costs on Russia for its war of choice in Ukraine. This action builds on previous determinations providing for sanctions against those that operate or have operated in the accounting, trust and corporate formation, management consulting, aerospace, marine, electronics, financial services, technology, and defense and related materiel sectors of the Russian Federation economy. SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS As a result of today\u2019s action, all property and interests in property of the persons above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.","title":"Treasury Targets Additional Facilitators of Russia\u2019s Aggression in Ukraine"},{"location":"notes/Tver%20Fuck%20War%20Posters/","text":"Tver Fuck War Posters \u00b6 2022-04-30 Protest Hearts & Minds https://libcom.org/article/anticipation-general-mobilization-7th-overview-anti-military-sabotage-russia all online surveillance cameras were offed in the downtown of Tver - both on the city administration's website, and from private providers.

These include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022. Soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing, and firewood. Those who carried out these abuses are responsible for war crimes. March 30, 2022 Devastation and Loss in Bucha, Ukraine \u00b6 Life for Civilians in a Town Encircled by Russian Forces \u201cThe cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,\u201d said Hugh Williamson , Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cRape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces\u2019 custody should be investigated as war crimes.\u201d Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 people, including witnesses, victims, and local residents of Russia-occupied territories, in person or by telephone. Some people asked to be identified only by their first names or by pseudonyms for their protection. On March 4, Russian forces in Bucha, about 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them. A witness told Human Rights Watch that soldiers forced the five men to kneel on the side of the road, pulled their T-shirts over their heads, and shot one of the men in the back of the head. \u201cHe fell [over],\u201d the witness said, \u201cand the women [present at the scene] screamed.\u201d February 23, 2022 Russia, Ukraine & International Law: On Occupation, Armed Conflict and Human Rights \u00b6 Questions and Answers Russian forces in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in Chernihiv region, rounded up at least six men on February 27, and later executed them, according to the mother of one of the men, who was nearby when her son and another man were apprehended, and who saw the dead bodies of all six. A 60-year-old man told Human Rights Watch that on March 4, a Russian soldier threatened to summarily execute him and his son in Zabuchchya, a village northwest of Kyiv, after searching their home and finding a hunting rifle and gasoline in the backyard. Another soldier intervened to prevent the other soldier from killing them, the man said. His daughter corroborated his account in a separate interview. On March 6, Russian soldiers in the village of Vorzel, about 50 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering. A man who was with her in the same basement when she died from her wounds two days later, and heard accounts of the incident from others, provided the information to Human Rights Watch. The child died immediately, he said. A woman told Human Rights Watch that a Russian soldier had repeatedly raped her in a school in the Kharkiv region where she and her family had been sheltering on March 13. She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife. The next day the woman fled to Kharkiv, where she was able to get medical treatment and other services. Human Rights Watch reviewed two photographs, which the woman shared with Human Rights Watch, showing her facial injuries. Russia-Ukraine War On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Many of the Ukrainian civilians we interviewed described Russian forces taking food, firewood, clothing, and other items such as chainsaws, axes, and gasoline. All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation. International human rights law, which is applicable at all times, also applies. The laws of war prohibit willful killing, rape and other sexual violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Pillage and looting are also prohibited. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility. \u201cRussia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cCommanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.\u201d For detailed findings, please see below. Kharkiv Rape On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha [not her real name], a 31-year-old woman in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: \u201cHe broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door.\u201d A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor. \u201cPeople started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three,\u201d Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said: \u201cHe told me to give him [oral sex]. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more \u2018motivation.\u2019\u201d He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear. \u201cWhile I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.\u201d The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things, so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. \u201cI knew my daughter would cry if she saw me,\u201d she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. \u201cI am lucky to be alive,\u201d she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal complaint, which they plan to file with Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Summary Killings, Other Violence On February 27, Russian forces rounded up six men in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in the Chernihiv region, and summarily executed them. Tetiana, from Novyi Bykiv, which faces Staryi Bykiv, just across the Supiy River, spoke with the relatives of four of the men who were killed. She told Human Rights Watch that on February 27, the bridge between Novyi Bykiv and Staryi Bykiv was blown up, and Russian forces shelled both villages. A column of Russian armored vehicles then entered Staryi Bykiv. \u201cMost people were hiding in their basements because of shelling, and soldiers went door to door,\u201d Tetiana said the families from Staryi Bykiv told her. The soldiers took six men from their homes: They took six men from three different families. One mother had both of her sons taken [and shot]. Another young man was in his early 20s, his name was Bohdan, I know his mother well, she told me that the soldiers told her to wait near her house while they took her son \u2026 to question him. They said the same thing to other families. Instead, they led these six men away, took them to the far end of the village, and shot them. Viktoria, Bohdan\u2019s mother, interviewed separately, told Human Rights Watch that on February 27: They took my son, Bohdan [age 29], and my brother-in-law, Sasha [full name Olexander, age 39]. We were in the basement [due to the shelling], so we didn\u2019t see. They went out to smoke. Then our neighbor ran up and said he saw them taking Bohdan and Sasha away, and a few other guys. Viktoria ran to the street to ask Russian soldiers at the checkpoint what had happened. \u201cThey told us not to worry, that [soldiers] would scare them a bit and then let them go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe walked away about 50 meters \u2026 and heard gunshots. It was about 6:20 p.m.\u201d Viktoria said that the next day she and her sister went to the meadow and saw the bodies lying by a building there: Three were on one side of the building, but not my son and brother-in-law. We walked around to the other side and saw [Bohdan and Sasha, and one more]. They were laying there. There were gunshots to their heads. Their hands were tied behind their backs. I looked at my son\u2019s body, his pockets were empty, he didn\u2019t have his phone, or keys or [identity] documents. Viktoria asked soldiers at the checkpoint for permission to collect the bodies, but they refused. Heavy shelling continued the following days. On March 7, Viktoria said, they again asked the soldiers for permission to collect the bodies: \u201cAt the checkpoint they told us to go the cemetery, that they\u2019d bring us the bodies.\u2026 Everyone [all the neighbors] came, like 75 people\u2026. We buried all of them on the same day, in separate graves.\u201d Viktoria said that the other four men buried that day were Volodymyr, 40, another Olexander, 40, and two brothers, Ihor, 31, and Oleh, 33. Tetiana said the soldiers also took all of the villagers\u2019 wood, leaving them nothing for cooking or heating their homes. On March 4, Russian forces summarily executed a man in Bucha, 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, and threatened to execute four others, said a teacher who witnessed the killing. She said she heard shooting at about 7 a.m. and saw three Russian armored vehicles and four Kamaz [Russian brand] trucks driving down her street. She was sheltering in the cellar with her two dogs when she heard glass breaking, and then her front door being broken down. Voices outside said [in Russian]: \u201cCome outside right now or we will throw a grenade.\u201d She yelled that she was alone in the cellar and came out with her hands up. \u201cThere were three men outside, two [Russian] soldiers and a commander,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took my phone and checked it, then told me to get my [identification] documents and come with them.\u201d As she walked down the street with the soldiers, she saw that they were also rounding up her neighbors and ordering them to walk. She said: They took us to where the office of AgroButpostach [a rental storage company] used to be. Right next to the building, there is a parking lot and a small square. They gathered people at that square, mostly women but there were also several men among us, over 50 [years old]. There were around 30 military there and the commander had [paratrooper] insignia [on his fatigues]. He spoke with an accent from western or central western Russia\u2026. I was born in Russia myself, so I pick up on such things. The soldiers were all thin and looked the worse for wear. She said that the soldiers brought about 40 people to the square, gathered everyone\u2019s phones, checked documents, and asked who was in territorial defense, or local self-defense units: Two women asked to go to the bathroom. One of them was pregnant. I asked to go with them. A soldier showed us the way to the toilet, which was around the building, I think it was now their headquarters. The building was long . Along the wall on the other side, we saw a large pool of blood. She said they waited in the square for hours in the very cold weather: At one point they brought in one young man, then four more. The soldiers ordered them [to] take off their boots and jackets. They made them kneel on the side of the road. Russian soldiers pulled their T-shirts, from behind and over their heads. They shot one in the back of the head. He fell. Women screamed. The other four men were just kneeling there. The commander said to the rest of the people at the square: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You are all normal \u2013 and this is dirt. We are here to cleanse you from the dirt.\u201d She said that after several more hours the soldiers took the people back to their homes. The other four men remained kneeling when she left. She said that when she was able to leave the town on March 9, the young man\u2019s body was still lying where he had been shot. Dmytro, 40, told Human Rights Watch that he and his family fled the heavily shelled city of Bucha on March 7. He said that they did not know of any safe evacuation routes, so they walked \u2013 wrapped in white sheets and waving white sheets in the air \u2013 for about five kilometers to the village of Vorzel. Once in Vorzel, they sheltered for two nights in the basement of a two-story building, with a group of local residents. Dmytro said that there was a woman with them in the basement who had chest and leg wounds. Other people in the basement told him that she had been shot the day before, when Russian soldiers stormed that same basement and threw a smoke grenade inside. Several people panicked and ran outside, where Russian soldiers fired at them. The woman was wounded, and the people in the basement told him that a 14-year-old child was shot in the head and killed. Dmytro said that the woman died the next day, on March 8. He and several local residents buried her outside the bomb shelter. On March 4, Russian forces threatened to execute a man and his son in Zabuchchya, a village outside the city of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv. A village resident said that on March 4, Russian forces entered the village, where he was sheltering with 10 other people, including a family from Irpin, in the basement of his home. In a separate interview, his daughter corroborated his account. He said that 13 soldiers entered his house to search it: The soldiers asked about my son, 34, who is in the territorial defense. He came out to meet them. They asked who was in the house and then they searched the house and turned it upside down.\u2026 In the backyard, they found my hunting rifle and a bottle of gasoline, and they went ballistic. The commander who gave orders to others said: \u201cTake them [me and my son] to the tree outside and shoot them.\u201d They took us outside. One of the soldiers objected. They took us back inside and ordered my son to strip naked because they said they wanted to look for nationalist tattoos. Other soldiers also went to houses on our street, including the house of a judge \u2013 she had gone and locked the house \u2013 and the local council deputy. They broke the window in the judge\u2019s house to get in. We saw them taking bags and bags of stuff out of the judge\u2019s house. After that, they left.\u2026 I took my family and everyone who was in the basement, and we fled in two cars. My wife and my son and mother, 80, are now staying at my daughter\u2019s house in Khodosivka [southwest of Kyiv].","title":"Ukraine: Apparent War Crimes in Russia-Controlled Areas"},{"location":"notes/Ukraine%20Apparent%20War%20Crimes%20in%20Russia-Controlled%20Areas/#ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-in-russia-controlled-areas","text":"Summary Executions, Other Grave Abuses by Russian Forces (Warsaw) \u2013 Human Rights Watch has documented several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations against civilians in occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine .

A 60-year-old man told Human Rights Watch that on March 4, a Russian soldier threatened to summarily execute him and his son in Zabuchchya, a village northwest of Kyiv, after searching their home and finding a hunting rifle and gasoline in the backyard. Another soldier intervened to prevent the other soldier from killing them, the man said. His daughter corroborated his account in a separate interview. On March 6, Russian soldiers in the village of Vorzel, about 50 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering. A man who was with her in the same basement when she died from her wounds two days later, and heard accounts of the incident from others, provided the information to Human Rights Watch. The child died immediately, he said. A woman told Human Rights Watch that a Russian soldier had repeatedly raped her in a school in the Kharkiv region where she and her family had been sheltering on March 13. She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife. The next day the woman fled to Kharkiv, where she was able to get medical treatment and other services. Human Rights Watch reviewed two photographs, which the woman shared with Human Rights Watch, showing her facial injuries. Russia-Ukraine War On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Many of the Ukrainian civilians we interviewed described Russian forces taking food, firewood, clothing, and other items such as chainsaws, axes, and gasoline. All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation. International human rights law, which is applicable at all times, also applies. The laws of war prohibit willful killing, rape and other sexual violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Pillage and looting are also prohibited. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility. \u201cRussia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cCommanders should recognize that a failure to take action against murder and rape may make them personally responsible for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility.\u201d For detailed findings, please see below. Kharkiv Rape On March 13, a Russian soldier beat and repeatedly raped Olha [not her real name], a 31-year-old woman in Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region that Russian forces controlled at the time. Russian soldiers entered the village on February 25, Olha said. That day, about 40 villagers, mostly women and girls, were sheltering in the basement of a local school. She was there with her 5-year-old daughter, her mother, her 13-year-old sister, and her 24-year-old brother. At around midnight on March 13, a Russian soldier forcibly entered the school, Olha said: \u201cHe broke glass windows at the entrance to the school and banged on the door.\u201d A guard opened the door. The soldier, who carried an assault rifle and a pistol, went into the basement and ordered everyone there to line up. The woman stood in the line holding her daughter, who was asleep. He told her to give him the girl, but she refused. He told her brother to come forward and ordered the rest of the group to kneel, or, he said, he would shoot everyone in the basement. The soldier ordered her brother to follow him to help find food. They left and came back an hour or two later. The soldier sat down on the floor. \u201cPeople started asking if they could go to the bathroom and he let them, in groups of two and three,\u201d Olha said. After that, people started settling down for the night. The soldier approached her family and told her to follow him. The soldier took her to a classroom on the second floor, where he pointed a gun at her and told her to undress. She said: \u201cHe told me to give him [oral sex]. The whole time he held the gun near my temple or put it into my face. Twice he shot at the ceiling and said it was to give me more \u2018motivation.\u2019\u201d He raped her, then told her to sit on a chair. She said she was getting very cold in the unheated school and asked if she could get dressed, but the soldier told her she should only put on her top, not her pants or underwear. \u201cWhile I was putting on my clothes, the soldier told me that he was Russian, that his name was [name withheld] and that he was 20. He said that I reminded him of a girl he went to school with.\u201d The soldier told her to go to the basement and get her things, so that she could stay in the classroom with him. She refused. \u201cI knew my daughter would cry if she saw me,\u201d she said. The soldier got a knife and told her to do so as he said if she wanted to see her child again. The soldier raped her again, put a knife to her throat and cut the skin on her neck. He also cut her cheek with the knife and cut off some of her hair. He hit her on the face with a book and repeatedly slapped her. Photographs that she shared with Human Rights Watch, dated March 19 and 20, show cut marks and bruising on her neck and face. At about 7 a.m. on March 14, the soldier told her to find him a pack of cigarettes. They went downstairs together. She asked the guard to give the soldier some cigarettes. After the soldier got the cigarettes, he left. That day she and her family walked to Kharkiv, where volunteers provided her with basic medical assistance. They moved into a bomb shelter. \u201cI am lucky to be alive,\u201d she said. She said that the Malaya Rohan council authorities were in touch with her and her mother and that the authorities were preparing a criminal complaint, which they plan to file with Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office. Human Rights Watch received three other allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers in other villages in the Chernihiv region and in Mariupol in the south but has not been able to independently verify them. Summary Killings, Other Violence On February 27, Russian forces rounded up six men in the village of Staryi Bykiv, in the Chernihiv region, and summarily executed them. Tetiana, from Novyi Bykiv, which faces Staryi Bykiv, just across the Supiy River, spoke with the relatives of four of the men who were killed. She told Human Rights Watch that on February 27, the bridge between Novyi Bykiv and Staryi Bykiv was blown up, and Russian forces shelled both villages. A column of Russian armored vehicles then entered Staryi Bykiv. \u201cMost people were hiding in their basements because of shelling, and soldiers went door to door,\u201d Tetiana said the families from Staryi Bykiv told her. The soldiers took six men from their homes: They took six men from three different families. One mother had both of her sons taken [and shot]. Another young man was in his early 20s, his name was Bohdan, I know his mother well, she told me that the soldiers told her to wait near her house while they took her son \u2026 to question him. They said the same thing to other families. Instead, they led these six men away, took them to the far end of the village, and shot them. Viktoria, Bohdan\u2019s mother, interviewed separately, told Human Rights Watch that on February 27: They took my son, Bohdan [age 29], and my brother-in-law, Sasha [full name Olexander, age 39]. We were in the basement [due to the shelling], so we didn\u2019t see. They went out to smoke. Then our neighbor ran up and said he saw them taking Bohdan and Sasha away, and a few other guys. Viktoria ran to the street to ask Russian soldiers at the checkpoint what had happened. \u201cThey told us not to worry, that [soldiers] would scare them a bit and then let them go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe walked away about 50 meters \u2026 and heard gunshots. It was about 6:20 p.m.\u201d Viktoria said that the next day she and her sister went to the meadow and saw the bodies lying by a building there: Three were on one side of the building, but not my son and brother-in-law. We walked around to the other side and saw [Bohdan and Sasha, and one more]. They were laying there. There were gunshots to their heads. Their hands were tied behind their backs. I looked at my son\u2019s body, his pockets were empty, he didn\u2019t have his phone, or keys or [identity] documents. Viktoria asked soldiers at the checkpoint for permission to collect the bodies, but they refused. Heavy shelling continued the following days. On March 7, Viktoria said, they again asked the soldiers for permission to collect the bodies: \u201cAt the checkpoint they told us to go the cemetery, that they\u2019d bring us the bodies.\u2026 Everyone [all the neighbors] came, like 75 people\u2026. We buried all of them on the same day, in separate graves.\u201d Viktoria said that the other four men buried that day were Volodymyr, 40, another Olexander, 40, and two brothers, Ihor, 31, and Oleh, 33. Tetiana said the soldiers also took all of the villagers\u2019 wood, leaving them nothing for cooking or heating their homes. On March 4, Russian forces summarily executed a man in Bucha, 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, and threatened to execute four others, said a teacher who witnessed the killing. She said she heard shooting at about 7 a.m. and saw three Russian armored vehicles and four Kamaz [Russian brand] trucks driving down her street. She was sheltering in the cellar with her two dogs when she heard glass breaking, and then her front door being broken down. Voices outside said [in Russian]: \u201cCome outside right now or we will throw a grenade.\u201d She yelled that she was alone in the cellar and came out with her hands up. \u201cThere were three men outside, two [Russian] soldiers and a commander,\u201d she said. \u201cThey took my phone and checked it, then told me to get my [identification] documents and come with them.\u201d As she walked down the street with the soldiers, she saw that they were also rounding up her neighbors and ordering them to walk. She said: They took us to where the office of AgroButpostach [a rental storage company] used to be. Right next to the building, there is a parking lot and a small square. They gathered people at that square, mostly women but there were also several men among us, over 50 [years old]. There were around 30 military there and the commander had [paratrooper] insignia [on his fatigues]. He spoke with an accent from western or central western Russia\u2026. I was born in Russia myself, so I pick up on such things. The soldiers were all thin and looked the worse for wear. She said that the soldiers brought about 40 people to the square, gathered everyone\u2019s phones, checked documents, and asked who was in territorial defense, or local self-defense units: Two women asked to go to the bathroom. One of them was pregnant. I asked to go with them. A soldier showed us the way to the toilet, which was around the building, I think it was now their headquarters. The building was long . Along the wall on the other side, we saw a large pool of blood. She said they waited in the square for hours in the very cold weather: At one point they brought in one young man, then four more. The soldiers ordered them [to] take off their boots and jackets. They made them kneel on the side of the road. Russian soldiers pulled their T-shirts, from behind and over their heads. They shot one in the back of the head. He fell. Women screamed. The other four men were just kneeling there. The commander said to the rest of the people at the square: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You are all normal \u2013 and this is dirt. We are here to cleanse you from the dirt.\u201d She said that after several more hours the soldiers took the people back to their homes. The other four men remained kneeling when she left. She said that when she was able to leave the town on March 9, the young man\u2019s body was still lying where he had been shot. Dmytro, 40, told Human Rights Watch that he and his family fled the heavily shelled city of Bucha on March 7. He said that they did not know of any safe evacuation routes, so they walked \u2013 wrapped in white sheets and waving white sheets in the air \u2013 for about five kilometers to the village of Vorzel. Once in Vorzel, they sheltered for two nights in the basement of a two-story building, with a group of local residents. Dmytro said that there was a woman with them in the basement who had chest and leg wounds. Other people in the basement told him that she had been shot the day before, when Russian soldiers stormed that same basement and threw a smoke grenade inside. Several people panicked and ran outside, where Russian soldiers fired at them. The woman was wounded, and the people in the basement told him that a 14-year-old child was shot in the head and killed. Dmytro said that the woman died the next day, on March 8. He and several local residents buried her outside the bomb shelter. On March 4, Russian forces threatened to execute a man and his son in Zabuchchya, a village outside the city of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv. A village resident said that on March 4, Russian forces entered the village, where he was sheltering with 10 other people, including a family from Irpin, in the basement of his home.

After that, they left.\u2026 I took my family and everyone who was in the basement, and we fled in two cars. My wife and my son and mother, 80, are now staying at my daughter\u2019s house in Khodosivka [southwest of Kyiv].","title":"Russia, Ukraine &amp; International Law: On Occupation, Armed Conflict and Human Rights"},{"location":"notes/Ukrainian%20journalist%20Oleh%20Baturin%20feared%20abducted%20by%20Russian%20invaders%20in%20Kherson%20oblast/","text":"Ukrainian journalist Oleh Baturin feared abducted by Russian invaders in Kherson oblast https://khpg.org/en/1608810185","title":"Ukrainian journalist Oleh Baturin feared abducted by Russian invaders in Kherson oblast"},{"location":"notes/Urengoy%20Gas%20Field/","text":"Urengoy Gas Field \u00b6 2022-06-16 fire Gas/Oil https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_mystery_fires The largest natural gas field in Russia [[Urengoy|Urengoy]] gas field [[Novy Urengoy|Novy Urengoy]], lies in [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug|Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] in [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen Oblast]] of Russia, just south of the Arctic circle and named after the settlement of Urengoy Novy Urengoy + 53","title":"Urengoy Gas Field"},{"location":"notes/Urengoy%20Gas%20Field/#urengoy-gas-field","text":"2022-06-16 fire Gas/Oil https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_mystery_fires The largest natural gas field in Russia [[Urengoy|Urengoy]] gas field [[Novy Urengoy|Novy Urengoy]], lies in [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug|Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] in [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen Oblast]] of Russia, just south of the Arctic circle and named after the settlement of Urengoy Novy Urengoy + 53","title":"Urengoy Gas Field"},{"location":"notes/Ussuriysk%20Military%20Air%20Base/","text":"Ussuriysk Military air base \u00b6 2022-04-25 fire Military https://www.intellinews.com/russia-on-fire-is-ukraine-giving-moscow-a-taste-of-its-own-medicine-242882/ Military air base in Ussuriysk. the fire in Ussuriysk thousands of kilometres from Ukraine's border and the discovery of a mine by a railway track in Bryansk the following day have added credibility to the theory that there are saboteurs carrying out attacks on the ground in Russia.

It is variously described as a private military company (PMC), a network of mercenaries , or a de facto private army of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Officially the group does not exist. While the Wagner Group itself is not ideologically driven, various elements of Wagner have been linked to Neo-Nazis and far-right extremists.The group came to global prominence during the war in Donbas in Ukraine, where it aided separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics from 2014 to 2015. Its contractors have reportedly taken part in various conflicts around the world\u2014including the civil wars in Syria , Libya , the Central African Republic (CAR), and Mali , often fighting on the side of forces aligned with the Russian government. Though welcomed by some allied factions, such as the governments of Syria and the CAR, Wagner operatives have been accused of war crimes in areas where they are deployed. The accusations include rapes and robberies of civilians, and at one point a video was published of Wagner PMC s torturing an accused deserter. Because it often operates in support of Russian interests or foreign policy objectives and is reportedly trained on installations of the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD), several sources consider PMC Wagner an arm's-length unit of the MoD or Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU. Likewise, the group is widely believed to be owned or financed by Yevgeny Prigozhin , a businessman with close links to Putin. It is speculated that the Wagner Group is used by the Russian government to allow for plausible deniability in certain conflicts, and to obscure the number of casualties and financial costs of Russia's foreign interventions from the public; it has most recently been tied to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, where it has been reportedly deployed to assassinate Ukrainian leaders.

Forced repatriation resulted in an estimated 5m people being sent back to the Soviet Union. To counter anti-Soviet ideology, more than 4m of them were subjected to filtration, undergoing rigorous screening, interrogation and incarceration in holding stations set up by the secret police and intelligence agencies. Some 280,000 ended up in gulags. Five decades later, filtration reappeared in Chechnya, a predominantly Muslim region in the northern Caucasus. During the two wars of the 1990s Russian authorities arbitrarily detained civilians at checkpoints, sending thousands to camps in an effort to stamp out Chechen separatism, adherents of which the Kremlin demonised as terrorists and bandits. Widespread human-rights abuses including rape, extortion, beatings and torture were documented by human-rights groups. In many cases, detainees simply disappeared. There are disturbing parallels in Ukraine.

A satellite image captured in March by Maxar Technologies, an American firm, showed Russian-backed forces had begun building a temporary camp of regimented blue-and-white tents in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne near the port-city of Mariupol, in south-eastern Ukraine.

Forms of activism range from mandate building in a community (including writing letters to newspapers), petitioning elected officials, running or contributing to a political campaign, preferential patronage (or boycott) of businesses, and demonstrative forms of activism like rallies, street marches, strikes, sit-ins, or hunger strikes. Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways, including through the creation of art (artivism), computer hacking (hacktivism), or simply in how one chooses to spend their money (economic activism). For example, the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a protest against the exploitation of workers by that company could be considered an expression of activism. However, the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of collective action, in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact. Collective action that is purposeful, organized, and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a social movement .Historically, activists have used literature, including pamphlets, tracts, and books to disseminate or propagate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the justice of their cause. Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action combining politics with technology. Left-wing and right-wing online activists often use different tactics. Hashtag activism and offline protest are more common on the left. Working strategically with partisan media, migrating to alternative platforms, and manipulation of mainstream media are more common on the right. In addition, the perception of increased left-wing activism in science and academia may decrease conservative trust in science and motivate some forms of conservative activism, including on college campuses. Some scholars have also shown how the influence of very wealthy Americans is a form of activism.

Wikipedia","title":"air base"},{"location":"notes/air/","text":"The atmosphere of Earth , commonly known as air , is the layer of gases retained by Earth 's gravity that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth 's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation). By mole fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude. Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth 's troposphere. Earth 's early atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. The atmosphere changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, life, and weathering. Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as global warming, ozone depletion and acid deposition. The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15\u00d71018 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, at 100 km (62 mi) or 1.57% of Earth 's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition. The study of Earth 's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and atmospheric physics. Early pioneers in the field include L\u00e9on Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann. The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology. Wikipedia","title":"air"},{"location":"notes/aircraft/","text":"An aircraft is a vehicle or machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air . It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion, usage and others.

With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described\u2014of which around 1 million are insects\u2014but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology. Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago. Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa. Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport . Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports.

Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads , seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people instead of goods.The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal -drawn carriages and carts. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy. Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads , land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries.

In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers; however, sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.Civilization, as its etymology (see below) suggests, is a concept originally associated with towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally connected with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution in West Asia, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state-formation, a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.

The violent nature of such acts are considered a severe breaching of human rights , hence the name. They differ from war crimes because they are not isolated acts committed by individual soldiers but are acts committed in furtherance of a state or organizational policy. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the Nuremberg trials. Initially being considered for legal use, widely in international law, following the Holocaust a global standard of human rights was articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Political groups or states that violate or incite violation of human rights norms, as found in the Declaration, are an expression of the political pathologies associated with crimes against humanity . Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts (for example, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Court) as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of customary international law. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative. Unlike war crimes , crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war. They are not isolated or sporadic events but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. War of aggression, war crimes , murder, massacres, dehumanization, genocide , ethnic cleansing , deportations, unethical human experimentation, extrajudicial punishments including summary executions, use of weapons of mass destruction, state terrorism or state sponsoring of terrorism, death squads, kidnappings and forced disappearances, use of child soldiers, unjust imprisonment, enslavement, torture , rape , political repression, racial discrimination, religious persecution and other human rights abuses may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice.

A person who commits espionage is called an espionage agent or spy. Any individual or spy ring (a cooperating group of spies), in the service of a government, company, criminal organization, or independent operation, can commit espionage. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome. In some circumstances, it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others, it may be illegal and punishable by law. Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. However, the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes. Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage. One of the most effective ways to gather data and information about a targeted organization is by infiltrating its ranks. This is the job of the spy (espionage agent). Spies can then return information such as the size and strength of enemy forces. They can also find dissidents within the organization and influence them to provide further information or to defect. In times of crisis, spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence-gathering. Almost all nations have strict laws concerning espionage and the penalty for being caught is often severe. However, the benefits gained through espionage are often so great that most governments and many large corporations make use of it.

At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems. Its negative effects include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water . Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil . This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil , but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is \"fixed\" and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are \"nitrogen-fixing\" such as clover, peas, and green beans.

A freight train , cargo train, or goods train is a group of freight cars (US) or goods wagons (International Union of Railways) hauled by one or more locomotives on a railway, transporting cargo all or some of the way between the shipper and the intended destination as part of the logistics chain. Trains may haul bulk material, intermodal containers, general freight or specialized freight in purpose-designed cars . Rail freight practices and economics vary by country and region. When considered in terms of ton-miles or tonne-kilometers hauled per unit of energy consumed, rail transport can be more efficient than other means of transportation. Maximum economies are typically realized with bulk commodities (e.g., coal), especially when hauled over long distances. However, shipment by rail is not as flexible as by the highway , which has resulted in much freight being hauled by truck , even over long distances. Moving goods by rail often involves transshipment costs, particularly when the shipper or receiver lack direct rail access. These costs may exceed that of operating the train itself, a factor that practices such as containerization, trailer-on- flatcar or rolling highway aim to minimize.

The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received. A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students and auxiliary healthcare students. A health science facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology. Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.

They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights \"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being\" and which are \"inherent in all human beings\", regardless of their age, ethnic origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances.The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law and global and regional institutions. Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide. The idea of human rights suggests that \"if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights\". The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, free speech or a right to education, there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard. It has also been argued that human rights are \"God-given\", although this notion has been criticized.Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust, culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society. Human rights advocacy has continued into the early 21st century, centred around achieving greater economic and political freedom.

Both the isocyanates and polyols used to make a polyurethane contain two or more functional groups per molecule. Global production in 2019 was 25 million metric tonnes, accounting for about 6% of all polymers produced in that year. Polyurethane is a commodity plastic.

Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed. Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes. Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps . In American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always followed in casual speech. A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government. A jail holds people for shorter periods of time (e.g. for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention ) and is usually operated by a local government, typically the county sheriff. Outside of North America, prison and jail often have the same meaning.

One who engages in sabotage is a saboteur. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions and to avoid invoking legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage. Wikipedia The Logic of Wartime Sabotage \u201cEverything in war is very simple,\u201d Clausewitz tells us, \u201cbut the simplest thing is difficult.\u201d The reason is friction: the routine bureaucratic hiccups that affect organizational performance. Armies are large, armed bureaucracies, subject to the same day-to-day annoyances as any other: broken machines, sick soldiers, paperwork errors, flat tires, and so on. Military leaders strive to coordinate the efforts of many individual warfighters, but normal friction gets in the way. In peacetime this is frustrating but tolerable. During a conflict it becomes much worse, as everyday glitches are amplified under the confusion and stress of organized violence. Wartime saboteurs seek to weaponize friction. Their actions are often covert, meaning that the victim does not realize that \u201cnormal\u201d malfunctions are actually by design. In some cases, this can include introducing faults during the design and production process of wartime materials. Sabotage may also include quietly disabling communication technologies, making it difficult for enemies to follow events and organize their response. The heart of sabotage is forcing dysfunction into adversary capabilities and organizations. Sabotage is not about winning a fair fight. It is about making the fight unfair. In some cases, sabotage can include more subtle methods of eroding adversary efficiency and morale. The World War II Office of Strategic Services, for example, encouraged civilians behind enemy lines to engage in a kind of inconspicuous sabotage. They did not ask civilians to take extraordinary risks to demolish factories. Instead, they called for an accumulation of inconveniences that would increase friction within them. Laborers could do this by \u201cstarting arguments\u201d and \u201cacting stupidly.\u201d Administrators could go further. The office offered memorable guidance on how to do so: Make \u201cspeeches.\u201d Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your \u201cpoints\u201d by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.\u2026When possible, refer all matters to committees, for \u201cfurther study and consideration.\u201d Attempt to make the committees as large as possible\u2014never less than five\u2026Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.\u2026Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision. Whether this activity had measurable effects on the war\u2019s outcome is difficult to answer, given the enormous scope and complexity of the conflict. Some sabotage operations clearly succeeded on their own terms, though their impact on the war itself was marginal. Because the strategic logic of sabotage is based on the cumulative effect of many small actions over time, it is inherently hard to assess its impact. Recent work on sabotage makes the similar argument that it is tactically useful but strategically indecisive. Technological changes, however, have raised the prospect of more dramatic results. Sabotage in Cyberspace Cyberspace, we are told, is a playground for saboteurs. The domain is gigantically complex, making it easy for attackers to lie in wait. It is also interconnected, making it possible for attackers to operate from afar at little risk. Saboteurs have a lot of options when they choose to go on the offensive, ranging from simple tactics like website defacement and denial-of-service attacks, to more ambitious operations to disable physical systems. Their choices have increased over the last two decades, as modern militaries have increased their use of information networks to coordinate their actions. Digital dependence allows them to work more efficiently, knitting together disparate forces and providing a mechanism for sharing intelligence in real time, but it also makes them more vulnerable to cyberspace sabotage. Defense against cyberspace sabotage is difficult for many reasons, not least the sheer number of networks and machines needing protection. Overlapping links between military organizations, defense firms, and other contractors also create possible security risks. The huge amount of software code that underwrites military hardware inevitably contains flaws, some of which are unknown to defenders until they are exploited. Human error compounds these problems. Lapses in operational security and cyber hygiene make it difficult for military and defense organizations to guard against opportunistic saboteurs. Observers have long believed that cyberspace is ripe for offensive action, implying that sabotage will have outsize effects in future wars. The main advantages seem to lie with the attacker, and recent books have stressed the new dangers of cyber attacks. David Sanger of the New York Times calls cyberspace operations \u201cthe perfect weapon,\u201d cheap and easy tools for debilitating the infrastructure on which we all depend. Publishing before the war in Ukraine, Sanger echoed the common belief that future wars would star with a cyber barrage. Nicole Perloth, also of the Times , warns that such attacks are potentially cataclysmic. Her recent book, which pays close attention to the Russian threat, is called This is How They Tell Me The World Ends . Yet cyber security researchers have repeatedly taken aim at this assumption. Low-impact sabotage (e.g., denial-of-service attacks) may be relatively easy to achieve, but more ambitious operations are not. These depend on exquisite intelligence, along with specially tailored malware that takes advantage of specific vulnerabilities. Access to target networks is often tenuous, meaning that even well-planned operations may never get off the ground. Saboteurs risk exposure as their objectives grow, meaning that defenders are more likely to spot planning for substantial attacks and take actions to defend themselves. Successful operations thus require a combination of time, money, skill, organization, and luck. States in conflict are likely to take extra steps to defend themselves against cyberspace operations, making wartime sabotage especially difficult. They can build redundant communications to ensure their reliability and harden existing networks. They can move data onto the cloud and away from domestic servers, which are vulnerable to physical destruction. And they can call on foreign allies and private firms for technical support. (Microsoft stresses this point in its latest report on the war in Ukraine.) The normal barriers to public-private cooperation prove less daunting when civilians are in real danger. For all these reasons, wartime cyberspace operations may prove to be relatively inconsequential, just as sabotage was of marginal effect in past conflicts. Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that most Russian cyberspace activities have served other purposes. Back to Basics Cyberspace was supposed to elevate the role of sabotage in war. Indeed, the existence of interlinked communications networks suggested opportunities for crippling information attacks, an irresistible prospect for leaders seeking quick and decisive victory. Sabotage, long a sideshow in conventional wars, might under these conditions take center stage. This has not occurred in Ukraine, however, where the war has descended into a contest of attrition and will. But this doesn\u2019t mean that Russia has been inactive in cyberspace during the war. Quite the opposite: It has been quite aggressive in terms of espionage and propaganda, both in Ukraine and abroad. These activities have a long history. Military forces have employed spies for millennia, seeking information on the size and disposition of their enemies, along with foreknowledge of enemy intentions. Access to secrets can enable battlefield victories, at least in theory, because they allow commanders to array their defenses against likely attacks and because they reveal opportunities to go on the offensive. Scholars have long debated the value of intelligence in war relative to material capabilities. This debate is somewhat misleading, however, because information improves the efficiency of military force rather than replacing it. The question is not whether intelligence is decisive but how it aids the use of force. Cyberspace espionage for military purposes is particularly appealing. Highly interconnected communications networks provide more entry points for collection, and concentrated data depositories mean that successful intrusions can release extraordinary amounts of information. The scale in cyberspace is much larger, as Michael Warner notes. Successful espionage offers more than dribs and drabs about the enemy\u2014it has the potential to offer a fine-grained view of enemy capabilities and intentions. All of this increases the risk of overloading military bureaucracies with more data than they can bear. Defense officials can reduce collection to alleviate the burden, or they can search for better information-processing technologies. If they choose the former, what kinds of collection are they willing to abandon? If they choose the latter, what sort of technologies do they have in mind? And how does their decision improve the use of secret intelligence for conventional military operations? These questions are not terribly exciting, at least not compared to spectacular acts of sabotage. But we might learn something about the practical use of cyberspace operations by asking them. Russia\u2019s experience in Ukraine offers a cautionary tale about expecting too much from cyber attacks, but it may yet reveal lessons about intelligence and war.","title":"sabotage"},{"location":"notes/school/","text":"","title":"School"},{"location":"notes/searched/","text":"","title":"searched"},{"location":"notes/sports%20centre/","text":"A leisure centre in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia (also called aquatic centres), Singapore and Canada is a purpose-built building or site, usually owned and operated by the city, borough council or municipal district council, where people go to keep fit or relax through using the facilities.

Mental disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders), physical disorders (such as chronic fatigue syndrome), and substance use disorders (including alcohol use disorder and the use of and withdrawal from benzodiazepines) are risk factors. Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress (such as from financial or academic difficulties), relationship problems (such as breakups or divorces), or harassment and bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts. Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance abuse; careful media reporting about suicide; and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common resources, their effectiveness has not been well studied.The most commonly adopted method of suicide varies from country to country and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods of suicide include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicides resulted in 828,000 deaths globally in 2015, an increase from 712,000 deaths in 1990. This makes suicide the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.Approximately 1.5% of all deaths worldwide are by suicide. In a given year, this is roughly 12 per 100,000 people. Rates of suicide are generally higher among men than women, ranging from 1.5 times higher in the developing world to 3.5 times higher in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries, those aged between 15 and 30 are at the highest risk. Europe had the highest rates of suicide by region in 2015. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common among young people and women.Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide as an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of suicide known as seppuku (\u8179\u5207\u308a, harakiri) was respected as a means of making up for failure or as a form of protest. Sati, a practice outlawed by the British, expected the Indian widow to kill herself on her husband's funeral fire , either willingly or under pressure from her family and society. Suicide and attempted suicide, while previously illegal, are no longer so in most Western countries. It remains a criminal offense in some countries. In the 20th and 21st centuries, suicide has been used on rare occasions as a form of protest, and kamikaze and suicide bombings have been used as a military or terrorist tactic. Suicide is often seen as a major catastrophe for families, relatives, and other nearby supporters, and it is viewed negatively almost everywhere around the world.

Standard networks of roads were adopted by Romans, Persians, Aztec, and other early empires, and may be regarded as a feature of empires. Cargo may be transported by trucking companies, while passengers may be transported via mass transit. Commonly defined features of modern roads include defined lanes and signage. Various classes of road exist, from two-lane local roads with at-grade intersections to controlled-access highways with all cross traffic grade-separated. The nature of road transportation of goods depends on, apart from the degree of development of the local infrastructure, the distance the goods are transported by road, the weight and volume of an individual shipment, and the type of goods transported. For short distances and light small shipments, a van or pickup truck may be used. For large shipments even if less than a full truckload a truck is more appropriate. (Also see Trucking and Hauling below). In some countries cargo is transported by road in horse -drawn carriages, donkey carts or other non-motorized mode. Delivery services are sometimes considered a separate category from cargo transport. In many places, fast food is transported on roads by various types of vehicles. For inner city delivery of small packages and documents bike couriers are quite common. People are transported on roads.

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the war-crime trials of the leaders of the Axis powers established the Nuremberg principles of law, such as the fact that international criminal law defines what is a war crime. In 1949, the Geneva Conventions legally defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise universal jurisdiction over war criminals.

The population was estimated at 905,364 (2021 est.) in the city core, with over 2 million in the metropolitan area (2011). According to the 2001 census, Donetsk was the fifth-largest city in Ukraine.Administratively, Donetsk has been the centre of Donetsk Oblast, while historically, it is the unofficial capital and largest city of the larger economic and cultural Donets Basin (Donbas) region. Donetsk is adjacent to another major city, Makiivka, and along with other surrounding cities forms a major urban sprawl and conurbation in the region. Donetsk has been a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of heavy industries and a skilled workforce. The density of heavy industries (predominantly steel production, chemical industry, and coal mining) determined the city's challenging ecological situation. In 2012 a UN report ranked Donetsk among the world's fastest depopulating cities.The original settlement in the south of the European part of the Russian Empire was first mentioned as Aleksandrovka in 1779, during the reign of the Empress Catherine the Great. In 1869 the Welsh businessman John Hughes founded a steel plant and several coal mines in the region, and the town was named Hughesovka or Yuzovka (\u042e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430) in recognition of his role (\"Yuz\" being a Russian-language approximation of Hughes). During Soviet times, the city's steel industry expanded. In 1924 Yuzovka was renamed Stalin. In 1929 Stalin was renamed Stalino, and in 1932 the city became the centre of the Donetsk region. Renamed Donetsk in 1961, the city today remains a centre for coal mining and for the steel industry. Since April 2014 Donetsk and its surrounding areas have been one of the major sites of fighting in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, as pro-Russian separatist forces battle against Ukrainian military forces for control of the city and surrounding areas. Throughout the war, the city of Donetsk has been administered by the pro-Russian separatist forces as the center of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), with outlying territories of the Donetsk region divided between the two sides. Donetsk International Airport became the epicenter of the war in 2014 with almost a year-long battle. As of August 2022, the DPR has full control of the city, with Ukrainian and DPR forces still engaging in combat touching the city.

Located in the northeast of the country, it is the largest city of the historic Slobozhanshchyna region. Kharkiv is the administrative centre of Kharkiv Oblast and of the surrounding Kharkiv Raion. The latest population is 1,433,886 (2021 est.). Kharkiv was founded in 1654 as Kharkiv fortress, and after these humble beginnings, it grew to be a major centre of industry, trade and Ukrainian culture in the Russian Empire. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was predominantly Russian in population, but as industrial expansion drew in further labor from the distressed countryside, and as the Soviet regime moderated previous restrictions on Ukrainian cultural expression, by the eve of World War II the greater part of the population was officially identified as Ukrainian. From December 1919 to January 1934, Kharkiv was the first capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Kharkiv is a major cultural, scientific, educational, transport and industrial centre of Ukraine, with numerous museums, theatres and libraries, including the Annunciation and Dormition Cathedrals, the Derzhprom building in Freedom Square, and the National University of Kharkiv. Industry plays a significant role in Kharkiv's economy, specialised primarily in machinery and electronics. There are hundreds of industrial facilities throughout the city, including the Morozov Design Bureau and the Malyshev Tank Factory (leaders in world tank production from the 1930s to the 1980s); Khartron (aerospace, nuclear power plants and automation electronics); Turboatom (turbines for hydro-, thermal- and nuclear-power plants); and Antonov (the multipurpose aircraft manufacturing plant). In March and April 2014, security forces and counter-demonstrators defeated efforts by Russian -backed separatists to seize control of the city and regional administration. Kharkiv was a major target of the Northeastern Ukraine offensive in Russia 's invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022. In May, Russian forces were pressed back toward the international border, but the city remains under intermittent Russian fire .

Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and its capture by Russia, it was the tenth-largest city in Ukraine and the second-largest in Donetsk Oblast, with an estimated population of 431,859, according to a 2021 census estimate. Following its capture, the population is now, according to Ukrainian authorities, estimated to be less than 100,000.Not only was Mariupol a centre for trade and manufacturing, it also played a key role in the development of higher education and various other businesses as well as being a Black Sea coast resort area. From 1948 to 1989, the city was named Zhdanov, after the Soviet functionary Andrei Zhdanov, as part of the practice of renaming cities after Communist leaders. Mariupol was founded on the site of a former Cossack encampment known as Kalmius, and granted city rights in 1778. Mariupol played a key role in the industrialization of Ukraine, and was a centre for the grain trade, metallurgy, and heavy engineering, including the Illich Steel & Iron Works and Azovstal Iron and Steel Works. In 2022, the city was besieged by Russian and pro-Russian proxy forces and largely destroyed, for which it received the title of Hero City of Ukraine. On 16 May 2022, the last remaining Ukrainian troops in Azovstal Steel Plant surrendered as Russia secured complete control over the city. Wikipedia The Mariupol mayor\u2019s office reports that four filtration camps are operating in the city. The accounts of these camps are harrowing. An escapee from Mariupol described the experience as follows: \u201cThe filtration camps are like ghettos,\u201d she said. \u201cRussians divide people into groups. Those who were suspected of having connections with the Ukrainian army, territorial defense, journalists, workers from the government \u2013 it\u2019s very dangerous for them. They take those people to prisons to Donetsk, torture them.\u201d Colleagues, what these reports describe brings back horrific memories of a bygone era. Invading a neighboring country, removing its legitimately elected government, herding its population into \u201c filtration camps \", and holding sham referenda in a transparent attempt to cover its aggression with a false veneer of legitimacy is a wholly barbaric enterprise. https://osce.usmission.gov/the-russian-federations-ongoing-aggression-against-ukraine-7/","title":"Mariupol, Mariupol Urban Hromada, Mariupol Raion, Donetsk Oblast, 87500 87590, Ukraine"},{"location":"notes/Maps/Mayak%2C%20Grigoriopol%20District%2C%20Administrative-Territorial%20Units%20from%20the%20Left%20Bank%20of%20the%20Dniester%2C%20Transnistria%2C%204006%2C%20Moldova/","text":"Grigoriopol (Romanian pronunciation: [\u0261ri\u0261ori\u02c8opol], Moldovan Cyrillic: \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b, Russian : \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0301\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c, romanized: Grigoriopol, Ukrainian: \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0456\u043e\u0301\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c, romanized: Hryhoriopol) is a town in the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester, Moldova.

He was released on September 12th, following a protest by the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe mission in Moldova.

It is the longest railway line in the world, with a length of over 9,289 kilometres (5,772 miles), stretching from Moscow, the capital of Russia and the largest city entirely within Europe, to Vladivostok, which is situated along the Sea of Japan. Russian Empire government ministers personally appointed by the Emperor Alexander III of Russia and by his son, the Tsarevich Nicholas (later Emperor Nicholas II from 1894), supervised the building of the railway between 1891 and 1916. Even before its completion, the line attracted travellers who wrote of their adventures. The Trans-Siberian Railway has directly connected Moscow with Vladivostok since 1916. Expansion of the railway system continues as of 2021, with connecting rails going into Asia, namely Mongolia, China and North Korea.

Moscow is among the world's largest cities; being the most populous city entirely in Europe, the largest urban and metropolitan area in Europe, and the largest city by land area on the European continent.First documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy that bears its name. When the Grand Duchy of Moscow evolved into the Tsardom of Russia , Moscow still remained as the political and economic center for most of the Tsardom's history. When the Tsardom was reformed into the Russian Empire, the capital was moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg diminishing the influence of the city. The capital was then moved back to Moscow following the October Revolution and the city was brought back as the political center of the Russian SFSR and then the Soviet Union. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained as the capital city of the contemporary and newly established Russian Federation. The northernmost and coldest megacity in the world, with a history that spans eight centuries, Moscow is governed as a federal city (since 1993) that serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of Russia and Eastern Europe.

Moscow is home to the seventh-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world. The Moscow International Business Center is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world, and features some of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.As the historic core of Russia , Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its various museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and is well known for its display of Russian architecture, particularly its historic Red Square, and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin, of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the Government of Russia . Moscow is home to many Russian companies in numerous industries and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and most notably the Moscow Metro, the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world.

The former Strastnaya Square name originates from the Passion Monastery (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0440\u044c, Strastnoy Monastery), which was demolished in the 1930s. At the center of the square is a statue of Pushkin, funded by public subscription and unveiled by Ivan Turgenev and Fyodor Dostoyevsky in 1880. In 1950, Joseph Stalin had the statue moved to the other side of the Tverskaya Street, where the Monastery of Christ's Passions had formerly stood. On 5 December 1965, Glasnost Meeting, the first spontaneous public political demonstration in the Soviet Union after the Second World War, took place here.

In Russia, Saint Petersburg is historically and culturally associated with the birth of the Russian Empire and Russia's entry into modern history as a European great power. It served as a capital of the Tsardom of Russia, and the subsequent Russian Empire, from 1713 to 1918 (being replaced by Moscow for a short period of time between 1728 and 1730). After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks moved their government to Moscow.As Russia's cultural center, Saint Petersburg received over 15 million tourists in 2018. It is considered an important economic, scientific, and tourism centre of Russia and Europe. In modern times, the city has the nickname of being \"the Northern Capital of Russia\" and is home to notable federal government bodies such as the Constitutional Court of Russia and the Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation. It is also a seat for the National Library of Russia and a planned location for the Supreme Court of Russia, as well as the home to the headquarters of the Russian Navy, and the Western Military District of the Russian Armed Forces.

Sakhalin is situated in the Pacific Ocean, sandwiched between the Sea of Okhotsk to the east and the Sea of Japan to the west. It is located just off Khabarovsk Krai, and is north of Hokkaido in Japan. The island has a population of roughly 500,000, the majority of which are Russians. The indigenous peoples of the island are the Ainu, Oroks, and Nivkhs, who are now present in very small numbers.The Island's name is derived from the Manchu word Sahaliyan (\u1830\u1820\u1865\u1820\u182f\u1873\u1836\u1820\u1828). Sakhalin was once part of China during the Qing dynasty, although Chinese control was relaxed at times. Sakhalin was later claimed by both Russia and Japan over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. These disputes sometimes involved military conflicts and divisions of the island between the two powers. In 1875, Japan ceded its claims to Russia in exchange for the northern Kuril Islands. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War, the island was divided, with the south going to Japan. Russia has held all of the island since seizing the Japanese portion, as well as all the Kuril Islands, in the final days of World War II in 1945. Japan no longer claims any of Sakhalin, although it does still claim the southern Kuril Islands. Most Ainu on Sakhalin moved to Hokkaido, 43 kilometres (27 mi) to the south across the La P\u00e9rouse Strait, when the Japanese were displaced from the island in 1949.

It has been a part of Russia since the latter half of the 16th century, after the Russians conquered lands east of the Ural Mountains . Siberia is vast and sparsely populated, covering an area of over 13.1 million square kilometres (5,100,000 sq mi), but home to merely one-fifth of Russia's population. Novosibirsk and Omsk are the largest cities in the region. Because Siberia is a geographic and historic region and not a political entity, there is no single precise definition of its territorial borders. Traditionally, Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, and includes most of the drainage basin of the Arctic Ocean. The river Yenisey divides Siberia into two parts, Western and Eastern. Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and to the northern parts of Mongolia and China. The central part of Siberia (West and East Siberian economic regions) was considered the core part of the region in the Soviet Union. Beyond the core, Siberia's western part includes some territories of the Ural region, and the far eastern part has been historically called the Russian Far East.Siberia is known worldwide primarily for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of \u221225 \u00b0C (\u221213 \u00b0F). It is geographically situated in Asia; however, due to it being colonized and incorporated into Russia, it is culturally and politically a part of Europe. European cultural influences, specifically Russian, predominate throughout the region, due to it having had Russian emigration from Europe since the 16th century, forming the Siberian Russian sub-ethnic group.

Transnistria controls most of the narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the Moldovan\u2013Ukrainian border, as well as some land on the other side of the river's bank. Its capital and largest city is Tiraspol. Transnistria has been recognised only by three other unrecognised or partially recognised breakaway states: Abkhazia, Artsakh and South Ossetia, and has a Russian military presence. Transnistria is officially designated by the Republic of Moldova as the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester (Romanian: Unit\u0103\u021bile Administrativ-Teritoriale din st\u00eenga Nistrului) or as St\u00eenga Nistrului (\"Left Bank of the Dniester\").The region's origins can be traced to the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was formed in 1924 within the Ukrainian SSR. During World War II, the Soviet Union took parts of the Moldavian ASSR, which was dissolved, and of the Kingdom of Romania's Bessarabia to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1940. The present history of the region dates to 1990, during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established in hopes that it would remain within the Soviet Union should Moldova seek unification with Romania or independence, the latter occurring in August 1991. Shortly afterwards, a military conflict between the two parties started in March 1992 and concluded with a ceasefire in July that year. As part of the ceasefire agreement, a three-party (Russia, Moldova, Transnistria) Joint Control Commission supervises the security arrangements in the demilitarised zone, comprising 20 localities on both sides of the river. Although the ceasefire has held, the territory's political status remains unresolved: Transnistria is an unrecognised but de facto independent presidential republic with its own government, parliament, military, police, postal system, currency, and vehicle registration. Its authorities have adopted a constitution, flag, national anthem, and coat of arms. After a 2005 agreement between Moldova and Ukraine, all Transnistrian companies that seek to export goods through the Ukrainian border must be registered with the Moldovan authorities. This agreement was implemented after the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) took force in 2005. Most Transnistrians have Moldovan citizenship, but many also have Russian, Romanian, or Ukrainian citizenship. The main ethnic groups are Russians, Moldovans/Romanians, and Ukrainians. Transnistria, along with Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Artsakh, is a post-Soviet \"frozen conflict\" zone. These four partially recognised or unrecognised states maintain friendly relations with each other and form the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations.

It is the second-largest European country after Russia, which it borders to the east and northeast. Prior to the ongoing conflict with Russia, Ukraine covered approximately 600,000 square kilometres (230,000 sq mi), and was the eighth-most populous country in Europe, with a population of around 41 million people. It is also bordered by Belarus to the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by Romania and Moldova to the southwest; with a coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast. Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city. The country's national language is Ukrainian, and most people are also fluent in Russian.During the Middle Ages, the area was a key centre of East Slavic culture under the state of Kievan Rus', which emerged in the 9th century and was ultimately destroyed by the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. After the Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia emerged, the area was contested, divided, and ruled by a variety of external powers for the next 600 years; including the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Austrian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Tsardom of Russia. The Cossack Hetmanate emerged in central Ukraine in the 17th century, but was partitioned between Russia and Poland, and ultimately absorbed by the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution, a Ukrainian national movement re-emerged, and formed the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917. This short-lived state was forcibly reconstituted by the Bolsheviks into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922. In the 1930s, millions of Ukrainians were killed by the Holodomor, a Stalin-era man-made famine. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine regained independence and declared itself neutral, forming a limited military partnership with the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States, while also joining the Partnership for Peace with NATO in 1994. In 2013, a series of mass demonstrations, known as the Euromaidan, erupted across Ukraine, eventually escalating into the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, which led to the establishment of a new government and pro-Russian unrest. During this period, unmarked Russian troops invaded the Crimean Peninsula, which was later annexed by Russia; and pro-Russia unrest in Ukraine's Donbas culminated in Russia-backed separatists seizing territory throughout the region, sparking the War in Donbas. This series of events marked the beginning of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, and in a major escalation of the conflict in February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since the outbreak of war with Russia in 2014, Ukraine has continued to seek closer economic, political, and military ties with the Western world, including with the United States, European Union, and NATO.Ukraine is a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system and a developing country, ranking 77th on the Human Development Index. Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe by nominal GDP per capita, and has high levels of corruption and poverty. However, due to its extensive fertile land, pre-war Ukraine was one of the largest grain exporters in the world. It is a founding member of the United Nations, as well as a member of the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the OSCE, and is currently in the process of joining the European Union.

Vladivostok is the second-largest city in the [[Far Eastern Federal District|Far Eastern Federal District]], as well as the Russian Far East, after [[Khabarovsk|Khabarovsk]]. The city was founded in 1860 as a Russian military outpost. In 1872, the main Russian naval base on the Pacific Ocean was transferred to the city, and thereafter Vladivostok began to grow. After the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917, Vladivostok was occupied in 1918 by foreign troops, the last of whom from Japan were not withdrawn until 1922; by that time the anti-revolutionary White Army forces in Vladivostok promptly collapsed, and Soviet power was established in the city. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Vladivostok became the administrative centre of Primorsky Krai. Vladivostok is the largest Russian port on the Pacific Ocean, and the chief economic, scientific and cultural center of the Russian Far East, as well as an important tourism centre in Russia. As the terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the city was visited by over three million tourists in 2017. The city is the administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District, and is the home to the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet of the Russian Navy. For its unique geographical location, and its Russian culture, the city has been called \"Europe in the Orient\". Many foreign consulates and businesses have offices in Vladivostok. With an annual mean temperature of around 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) Vladivostok has a cold climate for its mid-latitude coastal setting. This is due to winds from the vast Eurasian landmass in winter, also cooling the ocean temperatures.

Volgograd is the fifteenth-largest city in Russia, the second-largest city on the [[Southern Federal District|Southern Federal District]], and the fourth-largest city on the Volga. The city was founded as the fortress of Tsaritsyn in 1589. By the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn had become an important river-port and commercial centre, leading to its population expanding rapidly. Early in the Russian Civil War, in November 1917, Tsaritsyn came under Soviet control. It fell briefly to the White Army in mid-1919 but quickly returned to Soviet control in January 1920. On April 10, 1925, the city was renamed Stalingrad in honor of Joseph Stalin. During World War II, the Axis forces attacked the city, leading to the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the largest and bloodiest battles in the history of warfare. On 10 November 1961, Nikita Khrushchev's administration changed the name of the city to Volgograd. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city became the administrative centre of Volgograd Oblast. Known locally as the \"Hero City\", Volgograd today is the site of [[The Motherland Calls|The Motherland Calls]], an 85-meter high statue dedicated to the heroes of the Battle of Stalingrad, which is the tallest statue in Europe, as well as the tallest statue of a woman in the world. The city has many tourist attractions, such as museums, sandy beaches, and a self-propelled floating church. Volgograd was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

It originates in the Losiny Ostrov National Park northeast of Moscow, flows through Mytishchi, enters Moscow in the Medvedkovo District and flows through the city in an irregular, meandering, generally north-south direction. The Yauza joins the Moskva River in Tagansky District just west of Tagansky Hill, now marked by the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment tower. Valleys of the Yauza, from the MKAD beltway in the north to the Moscow-Yaroslavl railway west of Sokolniki Park, are protected as natural reserves.The Yauza has been mentioned in Russian chronicles since 1156; the exact origin of the name is unknown. Moscow crossed its former natural eastern boundary (marked by the Yauza) in the beginning of the 16th century. The banks of the Yauza within the Garden Ring were densely urbanized by the middle of the 17th century; upstream valleys housed suburban residences of the House of Romanov, from Mikhail to Catherine II. Settlements along the Yauza (German Quarter, Lefortovo, Preobrazhenskoye) played a significant role in the history of Russia in the 17th and 18th centuries. Industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries made the Yauza \"the biggest gutter for waste in Moscow\". In the 2000s the ecology improved, with the closing or conversion of old factories and cleanup efforts by the city government. In 2007 the Yauza waters were reclassified from \"dirty\" to \"polluted\" status, but in 2008 the trend reversed and pollution in the Yauza exceeded its 2006 levels.

The city is located at the confluence of the Oka and the Volga rivers in Central Russia, with a population of over 1.2 million residents, up to roughly 1.7 million residents in the urban agglomeration. Nizhny Novgorod is the sixth-largest city in Russia, the second-most populous city on the Volga, as well as the Volga Federal District. It is an important economic, transportation, scientific, educational and cultural center in Russia and the vast Volga-Vyatka economic region, and is the main center of river tourism in Russia. In the historic part of the city there are many universities, theaters, museums and churches. The city was founded on 4 February 1221 by Prince Yuri II of Vladimir. In 1612, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky organized an army for the liberation of Moscow from the Poles and Lithuanians. In 1817, Nizhny Novgorod became a great trade center of the Russian Empire. In 1896, at a fair, an All-Russia Exhibition was organized. During the Soviet period, the city turned into an important industrial center. In particular, the Gorky Automobile Plant was constructed in this period. Then the city was given the nickname \"Russian Detroit\". Shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union the city was renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again. In 1985, the Nizhny Novgorod Metro was opened. In 2016, Vladimir Putin opened the new 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant, which is part of the Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Corporation.
